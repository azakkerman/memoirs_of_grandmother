memoir works.</p><p>From Jewish life in Russia, I know only one, the &#8220;Zapiski Jewreja&#8221; by Gregor Isaakowitsch
Bogrow. To this work, which has opened up a deep and characteristic
insight into the life and activities of Jews in
Russia at the beginning of the 19th century, the memoirs of Pauline <em class="gesperrt">Wengeroff</em> are an equal complement. With profound love and great piety, with rare
fidelity and sincere truthfulness, with a gentle,
transfiguring humor and with fine psychological tact,
she tells us important episodes from a great transitional period,
from the time in which the Enlightenment among
the Jews in Russia began to break through the mists that had until then
hung over Russian Jewry, from a bustling, interesting, peculiar period
whose history has not yet been written, but can only
be written when we possess a whole series of <em class="gesperrt">such</em> memoirs.</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[vi]" id="pgepubid00006"><a id="Seite_vi" title="[vi]"/></span></p><p>The Russian Jews have been at the forefront of public interest in recent years. Their
destinies and sufferings have found the sympathy of the entire
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[vii]" id="pgepubid00007"><a id="Seite_vii" title="[vii]"/></span>
civilized world. Naturally, much attention has also been paid to
their character traits, their history, and their literature.
Only through this did wider circles come to realize
what a rich treasure of imagination and education,
of poetry and talent lies stored in these Jewish towns and
Jewish quarters of the vast Tsarist Empire, awaiting the great chroniclers
and poets who understand how to unearth this treasure.</p><p>Involuntarily, when considering the cultural work
so vividly described in the memoirs of Mrs. Pauline Wengeroff,
one is reminded of a remark by Nikolai Gogol
in his classic novel &#8220;Dead Souls.&#8221; The
hero&#8217;s kibitka races with furious haste across the vast,
boundless plain and finally disappears into the gray distance.
&#8220;And do you not also, my Russia, race forward like an uncatchable troika?
The road behind you steams, the bridges crack, you leave
everything behind. Spectators stand surprised
and ask: Was it lightning? What means this terrifying
haste, what mysterious power animates
these horses? What kind of horses are these? Do you have
whirlwind in your manes?&#8230;. Have you heard familiar sounds from above
and now strain your iron bodies, without touching the earth with your hooves,
to fly through the air as if inspired by a God?
Russia, where are you racing? Answer! There
is no answer. One hears the wondrous ringing of the horses&#8217;
bells; it groans in the air and grows, as if into a storm,
and Russia continues its bold chase.&#8221;</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[viii]" id="pgepubid00008"><a id="Seite_viii" title="[viii]"/></span></p><p>Fine ears will perhaps hear a part of the answer from the pages of these
memoirs, and attentive observers will learn to understand the rapid development of the
Jews of Russia from dark superstition and stagnation to the bright light of
enlightenment and inner freedom.</p><p>Then, too, the purpose of this amiable book is fulfilled,
which may my best wishes accompany on its way into the public eye.</p><p class="right pmb3">

event in my surroundings. Many occurrences imprinted themselves
on my memory like an impression in wax, so that I still remember them
quite clearly now. The events stand fresh and vivid before me,
as if they were from yesterday. With each year, the need
to write down my experiences and observations grew, and now the rich
material I have collected gives me the most beautiful and comforting
hours of my life, which has become so solitary in old age.
These are hours of celebration for me when I take up the notes
and often leaf through them with a silent tear or a suppressed smile.
Then I am no longer alone, but in good and dear company.
Before my mind&#8217;s eye, seven decades full of storm and stress pass by,
as in a kaleidoscope, and the past becomes a living present:
the cheerful, carefree childhood in my parental home, in later years
more serious images, sorrow and joy from the life of the Jews of
that time, and many a scene from my own home. These
memories help me through lonely, difficult hours,
over the bitterness of life&#8217;s disappointments, which probably no one is spared.</p><p>In such hours, hope also creeps into
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[2]" id="pgepubid00013"><a id="Seite_2" title="[2]"/></span>
the old heart, that perhaps it is not a wasted effort for others either,
if I have carefully collected yellowed pages about the more important events,
the tremendous changes in the cultural life of Jewish society in Lithuania
in the 1840s and 1850s, which also affected me.
Perhaps today&#8217;s youth will be interested to learn how it once was.
And if I have given something to even one of my readers, I am amply rewarded.</p><p>I was born in the early 1830s
in the Lithuanian city of Bobruisk. Raised by
strictly religious parents, intelligent, spiritually noble people,
I could follow the transformation that Jewish family life experienced
through European education, and convince myself how easy the upbringing
of children was for our parents, and how difficult this task was for us,
the second generation. We became acquainted with German and Polish
literature, studied the Bible and Prophets with great zeal,
which filled us with pride in our religion and tradition and intimately
connected us with our people. Their poetry deeply imprinted itself on the
untouched child&#8217;s mind and gave the soul for the coming days chastity
and purity, vigor and enthusiasm.</p><p>But how difficult it was for us then in the great transitional period
of the 1860s and 1870s!
We had indeed acquired a certain degree of European
education; but everywhere we felt the gaping gaps.
We sensed that even higher stages were to be climbed,
and sought with all our strength to make up for what was missing
and what we had neglected in our children. But unfortunately,
in our excessive zeal, we lost sight of the
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[3]" id="pgepubid00014"><a id="Seite_3" title="[3]"/></span>
ultimate goal and forgot the wisdom of moderation. So
we ourselves bear responsibility for the rift that arose between us and
our children, for their estrangement from the parental home,
which was bound to follow.</p><p>While the obedience we owed our parents according to the commandments
was sacred and inviolable to us, we now had to obey our children,
completely submit to <em class="gesperrt">their</em> will. As once towards our parents,
the watchword now towards our children was: be silent, be still,
keep your mouth shut, and even if it became ever so difficult,
perhaps even more difficult than before! If we listened devoutly
and with full reverence when our parents spoke of their experiences,
we now listen in silence, full of joy and pride, when our children
speak of their lives and their ideals. This subservience,
the admiration we have for our children, turns them into egoists,
into our tyrants &#8212; that is the flip side of the coin of European
culture among us Jews in Russia, where no other tribe so quickly
and irrevocably gave up everything with the adoption of Western European
civilization, abandoning all memories of the past, its religion,
and shaking off all tradition.</p><p>Our children found it easier than we did to reach a high level of education,
and we saw this with joy and satisfaction, for we often paved the way for them
and removed obstacles with great sacrifices. They found everything ready:
governesses, kindergartens, youth libraries, children&#8217;s theaters,
festivals and appropriate games, whereas the courtyard of the parental home
had to replace everything for us, where we indiscriminately romped around with the
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[4]" id="pgepubid00015"><a id="Seite_4" title="[4]"/></span>
poor neighborhood children and, with our little skirts pulled over our heads,
hopped and sang:</p><div class="center">
<div class="poem" style="display: inline-block;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;God, God, give rain &#8212;<br/>
</span>
<span class="i0">For the sake of the little children!&#8221;</span>
</div></div>
</div><p>What a difference!</p><p>I have attempted to describe all these transformations here.</p><p>I ask the readers for indulgence. I am not a writer
and do not wish to appear as such. I only ask that these notes
be regarded as the work of an old woman who, lonely in the twilight
of her quiet life&#8217;s evening, simply recounts what she experienced
and learned in an eventful time.</p><p>I know that my family chronicle will undoubtedly appear
to the youth of our days as if covered with thick mold or with
a thick layer of dust. And yet I hope that the knowledge of
Jewish life at that time, which is so vastly different from that of today,
will be of some interest to many who like to immerse themselves
in past times to examine and compare.</p><p>Thus I found the courage for my publication!</p><p class="pmb3">I cannot send this little work &#8212; the spiritual child of an
old woman, Bensekunim, as the Hebrews say &#8212; into the world
without thanking my friend Louise Flachs-Fockschaneanu
for her kind support. &#8212;</p><hr class="chap"/><p class="break"/><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[5]" id="pgepubid00016"><a id="Seite_5" title="[5]"/></span></p><h2 id="pgepubid00017">A Year in the Parental Home.</h2><h3 id="pgepubid00018">Part I.</h3><p>My father used to get up at 4 o&#8217;clock in the morning,
summer and winter. He strictly made sure that he did not move four
cubits from his bed without washing his hands.
Before he took the first bite to his mouth, he performed the
early morning prayers in a comfortable mood, and then went to his study.
It had many shelves on the walls, where numerous Talmudic folios
of all kinds and times stood lined up, in good company with other
Talmudic and Hebrew works of Jewish literature.
Among them were old, rare prints, of which my father was proud.
Besides a desk, there was also a tall, narrow table in this room,
called a &#8220;stand,&#8221; in front of which stood a comfortable armchair
and a footstool.</p><p>So my father went into his room, settled comfortably
in the chair, pushed the candles, already lit by the servant, closer,
and opened the large folio that had been lying there as if waiting
since last evening, and began to &#8220;learn&#8221; in the familiar chant.
Thus the hours passed until seven o&#8217;clock in the morning.
Then he drank his tea and went to the synagogue for morning prayer.</p><p>In my parental home, the time of day was divided and named according to the
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[6]" id="pgepubid00019"><a id="Seite_6" title="[6]"/></span>
three daily services: thus one said &#8220;before&#8221; or &#8220;after Davening&#8221;
(praying), for the later time &#8220;before&#8221; or &#8220;after Mincha&#8221;
(afternoon prayer); the time of dusk was referred to as
&#8220;between Mincha and Maariv.&#8221; Similarly, the seasons were named
after the holidays; thus it was &#8220;before&#8221; or &#8220;after Chanukah,&#8221;
&#8220;before&#8221; or &#8220;after Purim,&#8221; etc.</p><p>My father returned from the synagogue at ten o&#8217;clock.
Only then did the business work begin. Many people came and went,
Jews and Christians, the managers, the clerks, business friends, etc.,
whom he attended to until lunchtime &#8212; lunch was eaten at one o&#8217;clock.
After the meal, a short nap, then he had his tea.
Then friends would also gather, with whom he spoke about the Talmud,
literary questions, and daily events.</p><p>Thus, in the early 1840s, my father wrote a contribution to the &#8220;Eyen Jankow&#8221;, which he named &#8220;Kuntres&#8221; (Kunom Beissim), and in the early 1850s, he published an extensive collection of his commentaries on the entire Talmud under the name &#8220;Minchas Jehuda&#8221;. He did not entrust either work to a publisher for sale, but distributed them only to his friends, acquaintances, his children, and mainly to many &#8220;Bote midraschim&#8221; (houses of learning) in Russia. Jewish literature and most of its authors from that time and many centuries before, including the Talmud, made the great mistake of often disregarding dates and not stating them precisely. For example, in his last work, my father provided his family tree,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[7]" id="pgepubid00020"><a id="Seite_7" title="[7]"/></span>
which listed many rabbis and Gaonim, starting from his grandfather up to ten generations further back, but did not record the year of life and death for any of them. What was the life of an individual worth if only the study of the Talmud had a breeding ground!</p><p>This was how my father felt, who, faithful like his ancestors, dedicated himself to teaching and worship &#8230;</p><p>He usually performed the Minche gdole (evening prayer) at home and very early. For Maariw, he went back to the synagogue, from which he returned home around nine o&#8217;clock for supper. He stayed seated at the table, chatting with us about this and that. He was interested in everything that happened in the house, what concerned us children, sometimes the progress of our lessons. (My mother used to arrange for the Jewish teacher, melamed and scribe, as well as the teacher of the Polish and Russian languages.) My father was informed of all household and city events, while he, in turn, told us everything he had heard in the synagogue and what had been discussed there. This was the best entertainment for us, and what he told us was the most interesting newspaper. These oral traditions were called &#8220;pantoflowe gazeta&#8221;. Newspapers, as we have them today, were few then, and not accessible to everyone.</p><p>My father&#8217;s impulsive nature absorbed all events with strong emotion, which also communicated itself to his surroundings. We children listened intently to his wise speeches at the table. He told us about famous men, about their deeds, about their religious way of life, the Jewish laws, and we loved and esteemed him and held him higher
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[8]" id="pgepubid00021"><a id="Seite_8" title="[8]"/></span>
than all the people we knew at that time. I still remember two names he mentioned to us. One was Reb Selmele, the other Reb Heschele. Reb Selmele was so diligently occupied with Talmud study that he often forgot to eat, drink, and sleep. He became weak, thin, and pale, and his worried mother pleaded with him to eat his meals. But it was no use. Then the mother used her authority: one day she appeared in his small study room with a piece of cake in her hand and <em class="gesperrt">ordered</em> him to eat; at the same time, she told him that he would receive a piece of cake from her every day at this hour, which he would have to eat. The young man submitted to his mother&#8217;s will; but before he began to eat, he recited the Talmudic passage: &#8220;Kabed ow weem&#8221;, the commandments concerning the honoring of father and mother.</p><p>The second, Reb Heschele, was very clever and witty even as a child, qualities that remained with him throughout his great scholarship into his later years. He detested the cheder, along with the rebbe and the helper who forcibly took him there daily, even though he struggled with hands and feet; for he was a very lively child and loved freedom. One day, his father asked him, without any strictness, why he was so reluctant to go to cheder. &#8220;I feel insulted,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;that the helper drags me along without any respect. Why do they send you a messenger, if they want you, who <em class="gesperrt">politely</em> asks you to follow the invitation?&#8221; And sometimes you answer: &#8220;Good, I&#8217;m coming!&#8221; or sometimes: &#8220;Thank you, just as it was (i.e., if you want to go, you go, otherwise not).&#8221; The father promised him that he

would also be invited and informed the helper of this. When the helper kindly invited the little one the next day, he replied: &#8220;Just as it was!&#8221; &#8212; Another time, he put both socks on the same foot, to make the helper search for the second one for a very long time.</p><p>My parents were honest, God-fearing, deeply religious, philanthropic people of noble character. This was generally the prevailing type among the Jews of that time, whose life&#8217;s task was above all the love of God and neighbor. The greater part of the day was spent studying the Talmud. Only certain hours were devoted to business, although my father&#8217;s business often involved hundreds of thousands of rubles. He belonged, like my grandfather, to the class of Podraziki (contractors), who played a major role in Russia in the first half of the 19th century, as they did extensive business with the Russian government, such as undertaking fortress, highway, and canal construction and supplying the army. My father and my grandfather were among the most respected of these contractors, as they distinguished themselves by absolute honesty.<a id="FNanchor_A_1"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="1084587126728857420_45488-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_A_1">[A]</a></p><p>We lived in a large house in the city of Brest with many richly furnished rooms; we had a carriage

and expensive horses. My mother and older sisters also owned a lot of jewelry and beautiful, costly clothes. Our house was located away from the city. One first had to cross a long bridge spanning the Bug and Muchawiez rivers, and then passed many small houses. Then one had to turn right, walk about 100 fathoms straight ahead &#8212; and one stood before our house. The house was painted yellow and had green shutters. On the facade, it had a large Venetian window, with two more windows on each side. In front of it lay a narrow flower garden surrounded by a wooden picket fence. The house had a high shingled roof.</p><p>The entire estate, including the vegetable garden, was enclosed by a row of tall silver poplars, which gave the house the appearance of a Lithuanian manor.</p><p>Jewish family life in the first half of the 19th century was, in my parents&#8217; home as in others, very peaceful, pleasant, serious, and wise. It imprinted itself deeply and unforgettably on me and my contemporaries. There was no chaos of customs, traditions, and systems, as there is now in Jewish homes. Jewish life back then had a balanced style, bearing a serious, uniquely dignified Jewish stamp. That is why the traditions of our parental home have remained so sacred and dear to us to this day! But we had to endure much suffering until we were forced to submit to a completely different way of life in our own home, which will likely leave our children with few edifying and even fewer pleasant memories of their parental home!</p><p>Love, gentleness, and yet firmness were the parents&#8217; educational methods.
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[11]" id="pgepubid00024"><a id="Seite_11" title="[11]"/></span>
And a kind word helped overcome many difficulties.</p><p>An episode:</p><p>One morning, my father, returning from the city, found me alone and crying in the street. I believe a playmate had taken my doll. He became angry that I was wandering around unsupervised and asked irritably why I was crying. But I was so filled with my great sorrow that I could not answer and began to sob even more violently. Then my father became truly furious and exclaimed: &#8220;Just wait, the rod will teach you to answer!&#8221; He grabbed my hand and quickly pulled me into the house. My father had a rod brought to him and made preparations to whip me. I had become completely silent and looked up at my father in astonishment &#8212; I was never punished with the rod &#8212; and said, surprised: &#8220;But I am Pessele!&#8221; I was firmly convinced that my father had not recognized me and had made a mistake.</p><p>And it was to this self-assured behavior that I owed being spared the rod. Everyone present laughed and pleaded for leniency for me.</p><p>I particularly enjoyed working in the vegetable garden, digging up potatoes and other vegetables; I would ask the half-frozen women for the spade, then the rake, and wield them nimbly until the sharp, cold autumn air reminded me to run quickly into the house. After all the vegetables from our garden had been stored in the cellar, much more was bought at the market. Then came the very important task &#8212; pickling sauerkraut, which kept many poor women busy for a full eight days every autumn.
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[12]" id="pgepubid00025"><a id="Seite_12" title="[12]"/></span>
According to Jewish regulations, it is strictly commanded to carefully remove the small worms that nest in vegetables and fruits, especially in cabbage; and so, leaf by leaf was removed from each cabbage head, held against the light, and thoroughly examined. My pious mother was very meticulous in fulfilling the regulations and, if the cabbage was particularly good and of the best variety and had few worms, she used to give the women a special reward for every worm found, because she was always worried that the women were not attentive enough during the work. I also liked to watch here, as with the work in the vegetable garden, because the women sang all sorts of folk songs that deeply moved me and made me cry painfully, but also often laugh heartily. Many of these songs have remained in my memory to this day and are dear to me!</p><p>It was a peaceful life!</p><p>We live much faster now in the age of steam and electricity, so it seems to me. The hurried activity of machines has also affected the human spirit. We grasp many things much more quickly and understand so many complicated things without effort, whereas previously one could not comprehend the simplest fact. I recall an example that has remained in my memory and which I want to mention here. In the 1840s, my grandfather built the highway from Brest to Bobruisk for the government. Along the route were mountains, valleys, and swamps, so that a carriage journey took a full two days, while the same trip on the highway could comfortably be covered in one day. Everyone naturally spoke of the great undertaking for that time,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[13]" id="pgepubid00026"><a id="Seite_13" title="[13]"/></span>
but even in higher social circles there were skeptics who expressed their doubts and said: &#8220;As long as people remember, it took two days to travel from Brest in Lithuania to Bobruisk, and now Reb Zimel Epstein comes and tells us he will shorten it to a one-day journey. Who is he? God? Will he put the rest of the road in his pocket?&#8221;</p><p>In the second half of the 17th century, the roads in Lithuania and in some parts of Russia were still desolate. Endless steppes, swamps, and partly primeval forest stretched for miles, until the great Empress Catherine II had country roads planted with birch trees on both sides. However, the side roads were still very dangerous for both pedestrians, who were sent as messengers from place to place, and for travelers in sleighs and carriages, especially in winter due to the deep snow. To overcome these dangers, the horse post was introduced. This included the <em class="gesperrt">troika</em>, the <em class="gesperrt">three-horse team</em>, the postilion, called Jamschezik, a semi-wild, clumsy, always drunk peasant who lived and died with his horse. Also widely used was the <em class="gesperrt">kibitka</em>, a clumsy little cart whose four heavy wheels connected two wide wooden poles, on which rested a half-covered basket made of planks, or the <em class="gesperrt">telega</em>, an equally clumsy little cart without a cover. The horses&#8217; harness consisted of coarse leather, richly decorated with brass plates. The middle horse had a curved wooden yoke over its head, in the middle of which hung a mighty bell. The post stations, located about 20-25 versts apart, had an equally clumsy, genuinely Russian character as the vehicles. A
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[14]" id="pgepubid00027"><a id="Seite_14" title="[14]"/></span>
large room with whitewashed walls, a massive divan covered with black oilcloth, the long, wooden table also covered with oilcloth, on it the tall, narrow, dirty samovar covered with green mold, and a black, smoke-stained tea tray with dull, unclean glasses. The tall, thin, always, even at noon, sleepy, unwashed and uncombed station master in his unclean vice-uniform with the dull brass buttons completed the typical picture that still vividly stands before my eyes today, 65 years later. &#8212; However, only wealthier people could make use of this establishment, especially higher military officers and couriers who conveyed messages on horseback from the capitals to a provincial city, for which one now uses the telephone and telegraph.</p><p>The ordinary public used a simple wagon covered with canvas, drawn by two or three horses. The better public used the <em class="gesperrt">tarantass</em>, a <em class="gesperrt">semi</em>-covered carriage resting on two thick wooden poles, or the <em class="gesperrt">furgon</em>, a carriage completely covered with leather with a door in the middle. Not infrequently, these vehicles, along with their passengers, were buried by snowstorms in the open field. &#8212; It was not until the beginning of the 18th century that these inconveniences were remedied by the construction of highways. Now no mountain, no swamp, no forest hindered rapid progress, and the vehicles moved along straight, level roads. Safety was increased by the establishment of guardhouses with guards at regular intervals in addition to the post stations. The now more comfortable travel made the population more mobile. Trade and traffic developed astonishingly rapidly, and already at the beginning of the 1840s, the need for a faster means of transport became apparent. Then the so-called diligence was introduced, a comfortable carriage with two compartments, which transported twelve to fifteen people daily from place to place at a moderate price. It was drawn by three horses and driven by the postilion, who wore a peculiar uniform and blew a traditional tune on his trumpet. In Russian Poland, this means of transport was called &#8220;Stenkelerke&#8221; after the entrepreneur, and in East Prussia &#8220;Journalière&#8221;. People were generally very satisfied with this arrangement and believed they could never find anything better. Nevertheless, by the mid-1850s, the invention of the railway was already known in Russia, and by the early 1860s, long distances could already be covered by steam in the Tsarist Empire. In the 1840s, it took seven days with post horses to cover a distance of 800 versts, for which thirty hours were sufficient by railway in the 1860s.</p><p>No less significant was the development of transportation <em class="gesperrt">within cities</em>: initially, a miserable wicker cart on wooden wheels, slowly pulled by a horse harnessed with ropes, for the &#8220;common people&#8221;, and only for two persons; for the better public, the so-called droshky or &#8220;lineika&#8221;, which still exists today: a leather basket on hanging springs, two shafts, between which a horse with a curved wooden yoke over its head was harnessed. The lineika had space for eight people, with four people sitting on each side of a long seat,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[16]" id="pgepubid00029"><a id="Seite_16" title="[16]"/></span>
back to back. These vehicles shook and rattled the passengers for a long time on the bumpy pavement, and were only gradually improved to the point where the droshky was mounted on low, horizontal springs and the seat was fitted with feather cushions, until finally rubber tires around the wheels put an end to the shaking and comfortable, wide sofa seats replaced the cushions.</p><p>At the end of the 1870s, the horse-drawn streetcar was introduced and the first velocipedes appeared, until in the 1890s the electric tramway brought further perfection, which was then only surpassed by the automobile.</p><p>Road construction &#8212; which first enabled the perfection of means of transport &#8212; was awarded in the form of bids. Every late autumn, the Russian government in Brest organized the Torgy, i.e., the awarding of construction work and supplies. On this occasion, my grandfather usually came to us from Warsaw. Many &#8220;Padradziki&#8221; also arrived from other cities. Great preparations were made for my grandfather&#8217;s reception; my father was precisely informed in advance of the day of his arrival by estafette, mounted express messengers who changed horses at each post station. Already on the morning of that day, everyone in the house, and especially us children, was full of impatience and expectation. At the appointed hour, we went to the parade balcony or to the corridor to find a suitable spot between the columns so that my grandfather would notice us first. All eyes were fixed on the nearby bridge. The anticipation had reached the highest degree of tension. Finally, there was a rattling on the bridge, and
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[17]" id="pgepubid00030"><a id="Seite_17" title="[17]"/></span>
we saw my grandfather&#8217;s large, four-seater carriage, drawn by four post horses. (But also powerfully attracted by our gazes.) Each of us stood ramrod straight and brushed our hair from our foreheads, and our hearts pounded &#8230;</p><p>The carriage finally stopped in front of the balcony. A tall, gaunt, blond servant, in a footman&#8217;s coat with several successive collars, sprang from the box, opened the carriage door, and helped my grandfather out. He was a venerable, stately old man, still quite vigorous in appearance, with a long, gray beard, a high, broad forehead, and large, expressive eyes with a stern gaze. Yet his paternal eye rested with pride and tenderness on his son. It completely gladdened the old man&#8217;s heart that our father, despite his many businesses, still found enough time to diligently study the Talmud. How often the old man used to say that he envied my father for his great Talmudic knowledge and for the leisure he found for study.</p><p>My mother was greeted first by my grandfather, but without a handshake. He embraced my father, my older brother, and my brothers-in-law; to my older sisters and to us children, he turned with the words: &#8220;How are you, little ones?&#8221; But these few words were enough to make us jump for joy. Accompanied by the whole crowd on the balcony, my grandfather then went into the house.</p><p>We little children were not allowed to enter the festively decorated rooms immediately. We therefore took our way back through the door on the left and reached our room through the main corridor. My older sisters already had the right to stay with my grandfather and parents for the first few hours and participate in the discussion of business matters.
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[18]" id="pgepubid00031"><a id="Seite_18" title="[18]"/></span>
We little ones were only led to my grandfather by our mother the following morning, and he tenderly stroked our hair and cheeks. However, a kiss was rare. He had his servant give us the good Warsaw candies and oranges he had brought for us. Our &#8220;audience&#8221; lasted only a few minutes, however. We kissed the white, strong hand he offered us, wished the man we loved and esteemed so highly a &#8220;good morning&#8221;, bowed, and left without addressing an unnecessary word to him.</p><p>As long as grandfather stayed with us, there was a constant coming and going, a commotion, guests and business associates arriving and departing in the house, and carriages and cabs driving in and out of the courtyard. Lunch was taken later than usual. The large dining room table was set in the yellow parlor; all the silver, crystal, and porcelain dishes were used, and the courses and the length of the table were unusually extensive, as many guests had been invited. From my older sister to the youngest, no one found a place at the long table. To our greatest delight, a special table was prepared for us in the dining room, where our Njanja (nanny) Marjascha served us&#8212;a plump, rosy-cheeked girl with thick black braids and a red scarf wrapped around her head like a turban. My older sister Chasche Feige herself brought us tasty dishes, cakes, etc., from the large table. We
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[19]" id="pgepubid00032"><a id="Seite_19" title="[19]"/></span>
were freed from the strict discipline that prevailed over there and, left to our own devices, enjoyed the most complete freedom.</p><p>In the evening, other guests arrived, including many Christians, high-ranking military men, engineers, and building commissioners, with whom grandfather played Preference. A rich dessert was served, of which we children again received our fair share; and if we also got permission from mother to climb onto the stove in the dining room and light candles there, we asked for nothing more from fate. For on the stove, it was so cozy, so comfortable, there, where even during the day a semi-darkness prevailed, where in a corner our dolls with their little beds, clothes, and all sorts of tin pots, bowls, and the like were kept. Marjascha always kept us company, and she knew how to tell such interesting fairy tales. Oh, that was the place where we children forgot the world around us, no matter how lively things were downstairs in the splendid rooms: we were perfectly happy here. However, my mother only reluctantly allowed us to move onto the stove; for the way up was unsafe: one had to place one foot into a specially made indentation and quickly swing oneself up with the other foot in the air, often losing balance and falling headfirst onto the floorboards. Even up there, there was no lack of dangers; curious about the goings-on in the dining room, we stretched our heads over the edge of the stove, the other part of our bodies almost floating in the air. Only when one of us fell onto the floorboards did we become aware of the danger in which we &#8220;floated.&#8221; Nevertheless, we often obtained permission to settle down for an entire
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[20]" id="pgepubid00033"><a id="Seite_20" title="[20]"/></span>
evening in that longed-for spot. The stove up there formed a spacious square, where one could not stand, but only sit or lie down. For the ceiling was very low.</p><p>Things were quite lively in the rooms downstairs. After tea and dessert had been consumed, much business was still discussed.</p><p>There was a bustling activity, and peace only returned to our house once grandfather had settled all business matters. Grandfather had taken on the execution of the fortress constructions in Brest, for which my father had to supply many, many millions of bricks stamped with his initials J. E. For our farewell, we received beautiful gold and silver coins. Grandfather departed. The house became quiet again, like after a wedding in the forties (not at all like one in the eighties!).</p><p>Shortly thereafter, a new, dear guest approached&#8212;the Maccabean Festival (Chanukah) with all its cheerful and exciting events. Already on the Saturday before, the Chanukah lamp had to be cleaned and ready. We children were present during the cleaning, examining each individual part and delighting in it. The lamp was braided from silver wire and had the shape of a sofa. The backrest bore an eagle, above which a small bird of natural size sat with a miniature crown on its head. On both sides of the sofa were small tubes, in which wax candles were stuck, while on the seat stood eight miniature jugs containing oil&#8212;in memory of the small jug of oil that, as the legend tells, was once found in the Temple in Jerusalem after the expulsion of the enemies by the Maccabees, and which had sufficed for a full eight days for the
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[21]" id="pgepubid00034"><a id="Seite_21" title="[21]"/></span>
illumination of the Temple. In memory of this miracle, Jews annually celebrate the Maccabean Festival, which is primarily a festival of victory, by lighting lights and oil lamps.&#8212;The first Chanukah evening was awaited by us children with pounding hearts. Father performed his evening prayer, while our mother poured oil into the first small jug, drew the wick into the tubes, placed two wax candles into the small candlesticks on both sides, and one into the crown of the little bird. We children stood around her and followed her every movement with devotion! Father performed the ritual act: lighting the first light on the Chanukah lamp. He recited the prescribed prayer, lighting a thin wax candle with which he ignited the wick in the first small oil jug. Now the holiday evening began, for one was not allowed to work as long as the oil burned in the small jug.</p><p>What a joy it was for us children! For we too were allowed to play cards that evening. We brought out our few copper coins and considered ourselves millionaires. We sat around the table, and our little cousins also joined us. Meanwhile, our parents, adult siblings, and some acquaintances who had come to visit formed a larger circle. On the fifth evening of that week, my mother sent invitations to all our relatives and acquaintances. On this evening, we children also received the eagerly awaited Chanukah money from our mother, which usually consisted of nine shiny copper coins. People stayed up later than usual that evening, played cards longer, and a rich dinner was offered,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[22]" id="pgepubid00035"><a id="Seite_22" title="[22]"/></span>
where the so-called Latkes<a id="FNanchor_B_2"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="1084587126728857420_45488-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_B_2">[B]</a> formed the main dish. Latkes are a type of pancake made from <em class="gesperrt">buckwheat</em> flour with goose fat and honey; however, they are also prepared from <em class="gesperrt">wheat</em> flour with yeast, preserved fruits, and sugar, and are very tasty. As a drink, there was a type of cold soup, consisting of beer, oil, and a little sugar. In addition, there was black bread, cut into small pieces, and rusks sprinkled with sugar and ginger. Roast goose was served with all possible side dishes, salted and sour, among which sauerkraut and pickles could not be missing. Finally, a rich dessert of jams and fruits, during which the cellar and pantry suffered greatly. The guests examined, judged, and praised the dishes.</p><p>The outcome of the card game could be read on our faces; many lost all their Chanukah money and tried to hide their tears. There remained only one comfort: the hope that such game evenings would repeat themselves. Then luck would turn and fill the empty purse again.</p><p>On such evenings, my father even stopped his &#8220;learning&#8221; in the Talmud and joined the players, although he, like my mother, had no idea about card games. The &#8220;Dreidl game,&#8221; also called goor, was also very popular. The Dreidl was specially cast from lead. It has a dice-like shape. At the bottom was a point, so that the &#8220;device&#8221; could be spun like a top. A letter was marked on each of the side faces. If the Dreidl landed on &#149;, the player lost. If it landed on &#154;, the stake remained. If it landed on &#149;, he could take half of the stake. But if the Dreidl landed on &#149;, it was &#8220;goor&#8221;; the player could collect the entire stake.</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[23]" id="pgepubid00036"><a id="Seite_23" title="[23]"/></span></p><p>After the Chanukah week, life in our house returned to its old routine. Unless, that is, billeting disturbed the peace again: a visit from a high-ranking military or civil official. The fortress in Brest at that time still had no palace, and my parents&#8217; house was richly and comfortably furnished. The then commandant Piatkin, who was friends with my father, used to lodge important guests in our house. I can still remember many very well, for example, Prince Bebutov from Georgia in the Caucasus, who later held a high position in Warsaw. He stayed with us for a very long time, was friendly to us children, and very courteous to everyone. Often, while we played in the flower garden in front of the windows, he brought us candies and honey cakes, and conversed with us comfortably in Russian. He had a servant named Johann. He was tall and gaunt, had a hawk nose and almond-shaped, black, glowing eyes, climbed like a cat to the very top of the tallest poplar, skillfully performed the Dzhigitovka burduk by bending down from his fiery horse, which was galloping at full speed, to the ground to pick up a small coin. He was quite quick-tempered; one should not provoke him or get in his way when he was agitated, for he always carried a dagger with him. Thus, he once cut a dog in two with his dagger that ran in front of his feet. Another time, he caught a rooster in flight and tore its head from its body with his hands. We children feared him greatly.</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[24]" id="pgepubid00037"><a id="Seite_24" title="[24]"/></span></p><p>The second guest I can still recall was the then Governor of Grodno, Doppelmeyer, who often came to Brest and always stayed with us. He was a very amiable, strong, blond gentleman who was welcomed by us as a good friend. He considered it his duty to pay my parents a visit whenever he came. If this happened on a Friday evening, he was treated to a piece of peppered fish, which he consumed with great appetite. He also did full justice to the beautiful braided Shabbos (Sabbath) Challah. It must have been a pleasing sight when all my siblings with their young, blooming faces and my parents sat around the table. For the Governor said many flattering things about it and congratulated my parents. He conversed with my father about various serious matters and remained chatting until the end of the meal: The interaction between Jews and Christians was not yet poisoned by antisemitism back then &#8230;</p><p>Among the guests of my paternal home was also a small, Jewish man who came to us every year in midsummer and stayed with us for a few weeks. He belonged to the sect &#8220;Dover min hachai,&#8221; i.e., those who enjoy nothing from the living; what are now called vegetarians. However, he observed these rules so strictly that he would not even eat from dishes that had been used even once for meat dishes. My devout mother used to prepare the meals for him herself: a soup made from sour, red beets or sorrel, groat porridge without any added fat, prepared only with a little tree oil; furthermore, nuts in honey, or radish cooked in honey with ginger, tea, and black coffee.&#8212;
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[25]" id="pgepubid00038"><a id="Seite_25" title="[25]"/></span>
He was a quiet, most modest man and was greatly revered by all of us, especially by my father, who used to sit with him in his study, bent over the folios, and dispute.</p><p>Life in winter held a special charm for me. Especially when it snowed heavily, I loved to walk around outside. At dusk, when I started to feel cold, I would sneak into the &#8220;wing,&#8221; as the side building in the courtyard was called, where my married sisters lived with their husbands and children. My visit there was for the Njanja (nanny) of my sister&#8217;s little son. The Njanja often told me very interesting fairy tales and sang very beautiful little songs. I usually found her sitting by the cradle, which she kept in motion with one foot, while her wrinkled, blue-yellow hands knitted a dark gray, coarse wool stocking. I crawled with hands and feet onto the bed where she sat and, with all sorts of flattering words, asked her to give me the stocking to knit.</p><p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she grinned, &#8220;you&#8217;ll just drop the stitches again like yesterday. Go away from me!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Chainke, Jubinke,&#8221; I began anew, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t give me the stocking, then sing me one of the little songs you sing when you put Berele to sleep.&#8221;</p><p>Grumpily, she replied: &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like singing.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Are you sick, Chainke?&#8221; I asked her, concerned.</p><p>&#8220;Leave me alone,&#8221; she cried, jumping up. But I was not deterred by this peculiar mood of hers and repeated my request, which I supported with kisses on her wrinkled cheeks and stroking her crinkled neck.</p><p>&#8220;Mischelaches!&#8221; (Plague of God) she cried out, &#8220;to get rid of you (to get rid of you), I&#8217;ll sing for you.&#8221;</p><p>I settled myself as if she couldn&#8217;t sing without my preparation and listened.</p><p>And she sang:</p><div class="center">

me today!&#8221; She sprang up from her seat, screaming, so that a knitting needle fell into the cradle and the stitches slipped off it. Now I had no doubt that I would hear nothing more today. I remained sitting quietly until she had grumblingly and grimly put the stocking back in order; she looked at me with furious glances from the side, as if it were self-evident that I was to blame for the accident. I did not stir. And since she found the confession of my guilt in my expression, she was reconciled again.&#8212;Of course, my promise to bring her some of my afternoon snack also contributed to improving her mood. To get rid of me, she sang me a second song:</p><div class="center">

</div><p>Surely, the prospect of my afternoon snack encouraged her to this encore. Meanwhile, it had grown quite dark. I hurried back across the courtyard to the main building, where my siblings were already heartily enjoying their afternoon snack. Our nanny Marjascha could not keep up with cutting the bread and spreading the preserved gooseberries&#8212;our favorite dish. I got my share and poof! I was already on my way back to the wing building, where I was treated much more kindly than before by the now favorably disposed singer. And together we comfortably consumed the delicacy&#8230;&#8230;&#8212;</p><p>&#8230;. The greater half of winter was over, and the Purim festival with its exciting joys, with its many gift-givings, was at the door. At that time, it was
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[29]" id="pgepubid00042"><a id="Seite_29" title="[29]"/></span>
essential to prepare handicrafts for our cousins and nieces for Scholachmones (sent gifts). We worked day and night with great zeal, and when everything was finished, we delighted in the thought of how the recipients would be almost envious of our skill out of admiration. The longed-for Purim day drew ever closer. The day before was Esthertanes (Queen Esther&#8217;s Fast Day), on which all older family members fasted. Tasty Purim pastries were prepared by my sisters in the house. The main roles were played by Hamantaschen (triangular poppy seed cakes) and Monelach (poppy seeds cooked in honey). If they turned out well, one promised oneself a good year. We children were also allowed to help with this work, as we could snack to our heart&#8217;s content on this occasion. The whole day passed without the usual meals. But how great was the desire to be allowed to mingle with the adults in the evening and to be able to consume the baked, roasted, and cooked delicacies! And then the joyful prospect of the next day! In the evening, prayers were said at home. Afterward, a numerous company from the neighborhood gathered. Thereupon, the M&#8217;gilla Esther (the Book of Esther) was read aloud. And as often as the hated name Haman appeared, the men stamped their feet, and the youth made noise with the shrill Gragers (rattles). My father was annoyed by this and forbade it. But it was no use: every year it was done again.</p><p>Only after the reading of the M&#8217;gilla, which often lasted until eight or
nine in the evening, did one go into the dining room and
enjoy the appetizing dishes that were in rich abundance on the
table. Everyone helped themselves as quickly
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[30]" id="pgepubid00043"><a id="Seite_30" title="[30]"/></span>
as they could, to satisfy the loudly protesting stomach, which had received no food for more
than 20 hours.</p><p>Early in the morning of the following day, we children could
no longer sleep from excitement and called out to each other
still in our beds: &#8220;What is today?&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;Purim!&#8221;
was the joyful answer. And now everyone dressed
as quickly as possible. The joyful anticipation turned
into impatience. We wished the morning would finally
turn into afternoon, as that was when the Scholachmones
were sent and received.</p><p>My father and the young people came from the synagogue,
where a semi-holiday service had been held and the M&#8217;gilla
read again. Lunch was taken at an early hour (it consisted
of the four traditional courses: fish, soup with the inevitable
Haman&#8217;s ears, i.e., triangular crepes, turkey, and vegetables),
so that the second meal, the Seudah (festive meal), which
actually played the main role at the Purim festival, could begin
before evening. During this, the Jew &#8212; as is the custom &#8212;
gives himself over to true or perceived joy and is allowed to
get a little tipsy. As far as I can remember, every Jew on this
day is cheerful and happy; he indulges in good food and drink
and makes an effort days beforehand to raise a lot of money for the feast.</p><p>We children were only occupied with the thought of sending
and receiving the Scholachmones. Finally, the important
hour came when all the finished gifts were placed on a tea tray.
The maid was instructed which gift was intended for whom. With a worried,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[31]" id="pgepubid00044"><a id="Seite_31" title="[31]"/></span>
voice trembling with excitement, she was forbidden to stop
on the way or to speak to anyone, not even in passing.
She was to go directly to our aunts. Even the way she had
to place the tea tray with the gifts on the table and how she
had to hand each person their gift was precisely specified to her.
We vividly imagined the exclamations of delight that our
work would evoke. And we repeatedly showed the girl each piece.
Finally, the girl left and happily arrived at her destination.</p><p>&#8220;Were you sent by our aunt&#8217;s children?&#8221; the children
there rushed towards the girl, asking hastily &#8212;
for just as with us, they too had been excited and
impatient.</p><p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; stammered the besieged girl, who could barely
reach the living room, as everyone followed her, noisy and
questioning. They finally seized the tray, pounced
on the gifts to inspect, evaluate, and admire everything.
The clumsy girl did not do as we had ordered, as the recipients
took the items themselves without asking. Then the children
set about sending the gifts intended for us. That
happened in the next fifteen minutes. The poor messenger,
however, who had been received with such jubilation, left almost
unnoticed, quite silently, and was then questioned by us with the
same impatience and tension about whether they had been very
surprised over there, and what opinion had been expressed about
our gifts. Now we received the counter-gifts from our
cousins, which far exceeded our expectations or &#8212; not.
Upon receiving them,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[32]" id="pgepubid00045"><a id="Seite_32" title="[32]"/></span>
we had to restrain ourselves to remain calm. We were not
allowed to show ourselves as impatient and curious in front of
the messenger as we actually were; for our mother had
strictly ordered us to display calm, dignified behavior.</p><p>Meanwhile, all sorts of Purim plays (scenes from biblical
history, but mainly with a motif from the Book of Esther) were
performed. The first scene presented the Ahasuerus (King Artaxerxes)
play according to the Megillah, the one in which the King,
Haman, Mordechai, and Queen Esther had the main roles.
Usually, a young lad in women&#8217;s clothes played Queen Esther,
who was followed and stared at by us with curiously excited eyes.
The clothing of the other performers was not distinguished by
particular cleanliness and elegance. The triangular hat with the
plume, the epaulets, and the sword knot were made of dark blue
and white-yellow cardboard. The performance lasted longer than
an hour, and we followed it with the greatest interest. Then came
the Joseph play, whose most interesting scenes are borrowed from
the Bible. A lot of singing was done in all the pieces.
I remember exactly the melodies &#8212; and the comical dance
performed by Zirele Waans, a woman of the people, and a poor
man, Lemele Futt. They danced and sang in Yiddish.
We secretly giggled at the grotesque figures and their angular movements.</p><p>Most amusing for us children was the so-called Song of the
Kose (Goat). A hide with a goat&#8217;s head was held on two sticks
by a man who was inside it. The goat&#8217;s neck was hung with all
sorts of colorful glass beads
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[33]" id="pgepubid00046"><a id="Seite_33" title="[33]"/></span>
and corals, silver and brass coins, bells, and much other
shimmering, blinking stuff. Two larger bells were attached
to the two horns, which rang shrilly with every turn of the head
and combined with the other jingling trinkets to form a strange
&#8220;music.&#8221; The good man in the goat hide made all sorts of
movements; he danced, jumped up and down. The singing was
provided by the leader of the Kose (Goat) with a cheerful, hoarse voice.</p><p>The little song goes:</p><div class="center">
<div class="poem" style="display: inline-block;"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
</div><p>The singer was a gaunt, tall, blond fellow who
transported clay in our brick factory all year round and bore
the nickname &#8220;the Kose.&#8221; For us small children, the spectacle
was full of delights. But we could not entirely shake off a certain
feeling of fear and soon fled, after they appeared, to the stove
in the dining room, from which we could survey the events with
more safety. And there we watched with
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[34]" id="pgepubid00047"><a id="Seite_34" title="[34]"/></span>
interest how &#8220;the Kose&#8221; gulped down a glass of brandy that
our mother had brought to her mouth; then our mother put a large
Purim poppy seed cake into her mouth, which the Kose, as it
seemed to us, swallowed in an instant. We never came to a firm
conclusion as to whether it was really a goat or if a person was
inside it. The matter seemed quite mysterious to us&#8230;.</p><p>The joke was loudly laughed at, and the clay carrier was
dismissed with a good tip, for which he thanked with comical
gestures and blessed everyone. The scenes performed took place
in the dining room and were often interrupted by the many
messengers who brought Scholachmones. The messengers awaited
my mother&#8217;s instructions, who made arrangements for sending
the counter-gifts. On the long table were various kinds of
expensive wine, English porter, the best liqueurs, rum, cognac,
candies, oranges, lemons, marinated salmon. My mother and my
older sisters incessantly distributed these noble things onto
plates, bowls, and trays. There was no specific measure, no specific
number. A delivery usually consisted of a bottle of wine or
English porter and a piece of salmon, some fish, and a few
oranges or lemons. Such a compiled gift was mostly intended for
a gentleman. Gifts for women consisted of cakes, fruits, and
candies. People of lower standing received honey cake, nuts,
apples on a plate, which was covered with a red handkerchief
whose ends were knotted together downwards. I vividly remember
an exciting incident on Purim. My mother had forgotten to send
Scholachmones
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[35]" id="pgepubid00048"><a id="Seite_35" title="[35]"/></span>
back to a family friend.<a id="FNanchor_C_3"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="1084587126728857420_45488-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_C_3">[C]</a> She only remembered this late at night,
and she couldn&#8217;t sleep from annoyance about it. Early in the
morning, she quickly dressed and went to the friend to ask for
his forgiveness and to assure him that the error had not happened
out of disrespect, but out of forgetfulness. The assurance was
necessary, for the friend had indeed felt slighted and hurt.
Of such importance and significance was every Jewish custom back then!</p><p>The messengers came and went, and so the afternoon hours
from one to six o&#8217;clock passed, bringing us children nothing but
sweets and delicacies. This time my father usually used for his
afternoon nap. When he got up, the steaming samovar with
fragrant tea was already waiting for him on the table. Then he
performed the evening prayer. For the Seudah (festive meal) was
close at hand. (According to the rule, it must begin before evening.)</p><p>The large chandelier in the yellow drawing-room was lit. All
wax candles in the wall sconces were burning. The other rooms
were also brightly lit. The table was once again set with all
imaginable cold, tasty dishes. Special care was given to the drinks
that evening, which was otherwise not customary in our house.
It almost seemed as if our father considered it a good and God-pleasing
deed if someone got a little tipsy on Purim.</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[36]" id="pgepubid00049"><a id="Seite_36" title="[36]"/></span></p><p>That evening, we children performed a farce in which my older
sister and I used the clothes of the nanny and the cook. They were,
of course, too long and too wide and dragged behind us. My sister
portrayed a mother, I her daughter, whose husband had abandoned
her with a child in poverty. Good people should now help us find
the man, otherwise I would have to remain an &#8220;<em class="gesperrt">Agunah</em>&#8221;
(i.e., I was no longer allowed to marry) and had to await his return.
To the question of where we came from, we had answered in disguised
voices: &#8220;From Krupziki.&#8221; Our behavior and demeanor were so calm
and serious that even our mother did not recognize us at first, let
alone the guests. Father exclaimed: &#8220;How dared the servant let
these people into the dining room where there are guests? What kind
of nuisance is this?&#8221; We begged for alms in money or food, saying
we were hungry and had eaten nothing yet today &#8212; all of this we
spoke in the truest Yiddish. Our request for food and drink was soon
fulfilled; we were invited to take a seat at the table. We did so with
feigned embarrassment, and we gaped at and admired everything that
was served to us, not sparing sighs, which made our table companions
giggle. We were so well disguised, the adventurous headgear was
pulled so low over our foreheads, that we could carry out the joke
unrecognized to the end.</p><p>As far as I can remember, from my tenderest youth until the latest
times, on Purim at our house, there was always much eating, drinking,
and laughing until daybreak. Gaiety reigned to the point of exuberance.
All otherwise forbidden pranks and antics were permitted. All discipline
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[37]" id="pgepubid00050"><a id="Seite_37" title="[37]"/></span>
at table was suspended. The festival left behind the best memories
and also tangible souvenirs: a pretty necktie, a small perfume flacon
that one repeatedly turned over and over in one&#8217;s hands to read the
label, which one already knew by heart, again with renewed pleasure.
The small bottle was kept in the dresser for a long time until it was
used on an important and suitable occasion.</p><p>Already on the following day, on Shushan Purim, my mother held a
long consultation with the cook about the extensive preparations for
Pesach (Passover). The most important dish, red beets for pickling
for the &#8220;Borscht&#8221; in a &#8220;koshered&#8221; barrel, was already started on
this day. After a few days, Wichne, the flour seller, also appeared
in her inevitable fur and brought all sorts of flour samples for the
Matzah. My mother consulted with my older sister when testing the
flour; they kneaded a dough from the samples and baked small thin
cookies until the choice fell on a proven type of flour. One day before
Rosh Chodesh (New Moon) Nissan, my older sister had to sew a sack
(because my mother did not trust the cook to do it cleanly enough)
and this had to be done carefully at a certain distance from bread or
groats: My mother was so meticulous in all these preparations for
Passover that the cook often became exasperated and rude.</p><p>My older sisters prepared modern, pretty finery for the holidays.
Tailors, shoemakers, and milliners began to be frequent visitors to
our house, with whom seasonal matters were often discussed very loudly.
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[38]" id="pgepubid00051"><a id="Seite_38" title="[38]"/></span>
Rosh Chodesh Nissan drew near, and now the baking of the Matzah
began. This work constituted a task in the household economy with
which all household members, even father and mother, occupied
themselves. Already the day before, very early in the morning, Wichne,
the flour woman, appeared with the sack of flour under her fur, which
this time was covered in front with a long apron reaching up to her
neck. My sister brought the white sack, made of thin linen, into the
dining room, where Wichne also followed with the flour. We children,
of course, could not be absent there either, to devoutly help count the
measured pots of flour. So and so many pots were counted; the sack
was tied, placed in a corner of the dining room, and very carefully
covered with a white linen cloth. We children were strictly forbidden
to come near with bread or other food, which we found quite
understandable. The next morning, the indispensable factotum appeared,
the charwoman, who bore the nickname Meschia Cheziche, the same one
who had already functioned as a supervisor for all household chores
at the beginning of autumn. All her practical knowledge proved itself
mainly in pickling cabbage and storing vegetables in the cellar. She
lived with her husband in a clay hut near our brick factory, for which
he transported clay, but she spent most of her time with us. She was
truly a loyal soul who would have sacrificed herself for each of us
children. I never saw her other than in a ragged, blue-striped calico
dress and a pair of very large shoes that fell off her feet, which were
almost frozen even in summer, with every step. Her brown-blue frozen
face was wrapped with a formerly white calico cloth,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[39]"><a id="Seite_39" title="[39]"/></span>
a narrow red wool strip was tied around her forehead, and two ends
of a veil hung like wings at the back of her neck. Her small, dull eyes,
sunken deep into her head, always expressed benevolence and gratitude.
Her enormously wide mouth with thin lips seemed only able to utter
the words: &#8220;Good people, warm me up and give me something to eat.&#8221;</p><p>My sisters had a padded skirt and other warm clothes made for her
every autumn. However, every attempt to warm up this completely
frozen being failed. So Meschia Cheziche came; first, she received a
plate full of hot groat soup in the kitchen, and after she was satisfied
and had warmed up a bit, she crept to the dining room door, poked her
head through the half-open door, and announced herself. My mother
ordered her to wash herself properly; then a long, white shirt was
pulled over the gaunt figure&#8217;s clothes, and her headgear was wrapped
with a white linen cloth that also covered her wide mouth. In this
attire, which gave her a ghostly appearance, she now had to sift the
flour for the Matzah. After she had blessed my mother with the words:
&#8220;May you live to see another year (future year) with your husband
and children in great joy!&#8221; she began to pour one sieve after another
onto the prepared table. What a delightful sight to see this apparition
at work! We children stood at a measured distance and watched
attentively. Meschia Cheziche was strictly forbidden to speak, so that
no droplet from her mouth would fall into the flour. After finishing
her work, she stayed the night in the kitchen, and early in the morning,
she scrubbed the large red chests,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[40]" id="pgepubid00052"><a id="Seite_40" title="[40]"/></span>
in which clean laundry was stored all year round, and, although they
never came into contact with food, she took hold of them with strong
hands and washed them thoroughly so that they would receive the Matzah
in impeccable purity. Then it was the turn of the wooden tables and
benches, which also felt the power of the scrubbing brush wielded by
Meschia Cheziche. The many dozens of rolling pins and baking sheets,
which were also thoroughly cleaned, were not spared. Two large brass
basins were also mercilessly rubbed and scrubbed; red-hot iron rods
were placed in them, and first boiling, then cold water was poured
over them for so long &#8212; such cleaning is called &#8220;kashering&#8221; by the
Jews &#8212; until the water overflowed; later they were scrubbed again and
then polished until they sparkled.</p><p>The most important thing when baking Matzah is fetching water from
the well or river, which is considered a great Mitzvah (a God-pleasing
act). The utensils for the Matzah water consist of two large wooden
buckets covered with gray canvas, a pail with a large scoop, and two
long poles. Any missing utensils were, of course, newly supplemented.
After the large kitchen in the courtyard was cleaned, the bricks of the
oven were glowing hot and &#8220;koshered,&#8221; a lot of dry, resinous wood,
which our trusted old watchman Feiwele had collected for this purpose
throughout the winter, was brought into the kitchen. On the eve before
Rosh Chodesh Nissan, there was a strange spectacle in the courtyard in
front of the well or by the nearby river: My father, my brothers-in-law,
personally went, carrying the water buckets on long poles, to the well
or river to fetch water and bring it to the large kitchen,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[41]" id="pgepubid00053"><a id="Seite_41" title="[41]"/></span>
where the buckets were placed on a hay-covered bench. My mother and we
children soon ran ahead of the strange procession; then behind it. The
young men were cheerful and lively. My father, however, was serious,
for these customs were sacred to him as a God-pleasing act. My
brothers-in-law also brought the well-kept, veiled sack of flour into
the large kitchen. Meschia Cheziche stayed the night there to heat the
oven in good time the next morning. Everyone went to bed early so they
could be present at the start of the Matzah baking.</p><p>The next morning, I immediately pushed my way to the oven and watched with great interest how skillfully an old woman slid the round, thin matzos into the oven, moved the half-baked ones aside, gathered the fully baked ones with both hands, and threw them into a basket on the nearby bench, without a single one breaking, even though they were so thin and fragile. I was soon assigned a task: I was to hand the cut pieces of dough to the women armed with rolling pins, who stood around the long table covered with metal plates. My older sister had always surpassed me in waking up early; even now, she proudly told me that she had already rolled out many matzos, which were even already baked. I was very dissatisfied with myself, scolded myself for being a late sleeper, and now tried to make myself even more useful. I only calmed down about waking up late when all the running around and standing had thoroughly tired me out. I washed my hands and went into the second chamber, where the dough was being kneaded. There, a woman stood bent over a sparkling brass basin, kneading, without making a sound, one <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[42]" id="pgepubid00054"><a id="Seite_42" title="[42]"/></span> piece of dough after another from measured flour and water. I also made myself useful there by asking the little boy, who was supposed to pour the water into the flour, for the large dipper and carefully and quietly carried out his work, now and then looking at the kneading woman, who, like Meschia Cheziche, wore a long, white shirt over her clothes and an apron that was not cinched at the waist. Her head and mouth were covered with white cloths, just like Meschia Cheziche. I helped until fatigue overcame me.</p><p>The baking of the matzos lasted almost two days. My mother tirelessly went around and from time to time inspected the rolling pins with which the women rolled the matzos, to scrape off any stuck dough; my brothers-in-law and my brother, armed with small pieces of glass shards, helped with this work. The particles had to be removed because the stuck dough was already Chometz (i.e., <em class="gesperrt">leavened</em> dough), and thus must not be kneaded into the matzo dough (which is <em class="gesperrt">unleavened</em>). The young men also helped with the &#8220;raddling&#8221; of the matzos; and it occurred to no one to consider such work inappropriate, as everything concerning Passover, and especially the matzos, was regarded as a religious act. The following day, my mother examined all the matzos, of which there were often several thousand, to see if there was not a bent or not fully baked one among them. For such a one was already Chometz and had to be removed.</p><p>In strict order, the flawless matzos were now laid in rows in the large red boxes, which were covered with a white cloth. My mother had taken a matzo from under the cloth <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[43]" id="pgepubid00055"><a id="Seite_43" title="[43]"/></span> and, without looking at it, even with her eyes closed, broken off half of it, while softly reciting a pious prayer specifically designated for this act. Then she threw this piece of matzo back into the flames, without looking at it. This custom was called &#8220;taking Challah&#8221;; it is probably meant to recall the burnt offering of biblical times.</p><p>The time until Passover passed in endless preparations for the household, for clothes and finery. Finally, the important day of Erev-Pesach approached. Then the work reached its peak! The evening before, a ritual act is also performed: the Bedikat Chometz, i.e., the removal of leavened bread dough from the house. My mother went into the kitchen, had the cook give her a wooden spoon and some goose feathers, wrapped a white cloth around both, took a small wax candle with it, tied the whole thing firmly with a string, and brought it into my father&#8217;s room, where she placed it on the windowsill. These seemingly insignificant objects were to be used in a religious ceremony in the evening. My father, after he had prayed in the evening, took the bundle, lit the small wax candle, and handed it to my brother, whose hand was to serve as a candlestick for him, and now the campaign against the Chometz went through the entire house. Every windowsill, every corner where food was suspected, was examined by my father and illuminated by my brother with the small wax candle. The crumbs found were scraped with the feathers into the spoon, after my father had recited the designated prayer. We children sometimes made a game of piling up crumbs everywhere beforehand, <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[44]" id="pgepubid00056"><a id="Seite_44" title="[44]"/></span> which surprised Father, as on this day the windowsills were usually cleaned with special care. So he thoroughly examined the windows, and Mother had to hurry to remove the remaining bread from the house, for the law commanded that all bread found during the search through the house be collected and burned. After this act was completed, supper was eaten a little earlier than usual. The bread that had been hidden in the meantime was now allowed to come to the table, but the collected breadcrumbs in the spoon, along with the small wax candle and the feathers, were tied in a cloth and fastened quite high on the hanging chandelier in the dining room, so that no mouse could reach it and scatter the crumbs again. We went to bed early to get up very early the next morning, because by 9 o&#8217;clock in the morning, not a single bite of bread or any other Chometz may be found in the house of a religious Jew. We children were woken very early and were supposed to eat breakfast and lunch at once. The national dish for this morning is hot boiled milk with white bread. But even at this early hour, a roast was already ready, which many household members enjoyed. &#8220;And now quickly, quickly!&#8221; my mother urged everyone in the house, even the servants ate twice as much as usual, for nothing of the Chometz was allowed to remain. We children played all sorts of tricks and then said goodbye to bread for a full eight days. The dishes were quickly washed, and Mother ordered the servant to bring everything into the dining room. From the expensive porcelain service to the last copper casserole, all pieces were placed in colorful disarray on the floor, the table, the windows, and then everything had to be packed into large <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[45]"><a id="Seite_45" title="[45]"/></span> boxes and brought to the attic, from where the filled boxes with the Passover dishes were then carried down. The dining room was thoroughly cleaned again, the windowsills covered with white paper. The large dining table was pulled apart, covered with a white cloth or paper, and then the table, extended to its full length, was covered with thick felt, a layer of hay, and much gray linen, which was fastened with small nails. Only after this procedure could the Passover dishes be unpacked, which we children awaited with such great curiosity, because each of us had our specific Kaus (small, prettily shaped cup) among them. But that was not all! At this time, there was also much of interest for us to see in all places and in all rooms, especially in the courtyard, where all the wooden tables and benches were set up for kashering. The table or bench was doused with boiling water, a glowing iron was rubbed back and forth over it, and then cold water was immediately poured over the objects. Besides this spectacle, there was something even grander: Father appeared in the kitchen doorway with yesterday&#8217;s Chometz in his right hand and had Feiwele, the old watchman, bring bricks and dry pieces of wood. The old man did this in a flash, built a small hearth from the bricks, and placed the pieces of wood on it. My father placed the spoon with the crumbs inside on the pyre and had the wood set on fire. We children ran back and forth, trying to make ourselves useful if at all possible. The dry wood immediately caught fire, and one small flame after another flickered from the pyre. And we children shouted: &#8220;Look, look, the feathers are <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[46]"><a id="Seite_46" title="[46]"/></span> already singed! The cloth is already burning &#8230;&#8221; Finally, the combined flames also consumed the spoon, and it took no longer than 10 minutes for the auto-da-fé of the Chometz to be completed. My father did not leave the scene until all remnants of the pyre had been cleared away, for according to the regulation, one must not even step on the ashes, even if it would bring &#8220;benefit or pleasure.&#8221;</p><p>From there, we children sprang into the dining room, where &#8220;Shimen, the Meshores&#8221; (the servant) was busy unpacking the Passover dishes. We wanted to help here too and take possession of our Kausses (small wine cups), when the Bocher (boy) smiled mischievously and said that we were not yet properly prepared for that. We were stunned and looked at him questioningly and dismayed. With an indifferent expression, he explained that we had not yet been scrubbed and kashered. &#8220;How kashered?&#8221; we asked. &#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; our tormentor retorted, &#8220;You must take hot, glowing Steindelach (small stones) into your mouth, roll them around there, then rinse with cold water, spit them out, and only then may you touch these dishes.&#8221; We found no answer and rushed, crying, into the kitchen, where my mother was in full swing. She was just consulting with the cook about the preparation of the Indian bird, a huge turkey that had already been slaughtered, plucked, singed, salted, and rinsed three times with water. Now it lay on the board, and the cook held it with both hands as if it wanted to fly away, while Mother, armed with a large kitchen knife, made the main cut. Not far from this scene, to the right of the bench, lay on a newly planed board, in its full length, a silver-scaled pike from the Bug River, still awaiting <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[47]" id="pgepubid00057"><a id="Seite_47" title="[47]"/></span> artistic treatment. On the left side stood the cleanly scrubbed kitchen table, on which various bowls, plates, forks, spoons were placed, furthermore a large basket of eggs, a pot of matzo meal, which my sister was just sifting and from which the tasty tarts, almond cakes, etc., were later prepared. We now wanted to ask Mother if Simon was right. But we remained standing, captivated by Mother&#8217;s busy work. The terrible thought of the glowing Steindelach in our mouths wrung a soft sob from us, and my younger sister persuaded me to question Mother after all. But Mother anticipated us. Our whispering had long since caught her attention, and, half surprised, half annoyed, she asked us why we had rushed so impetuously into the kitchen. Then we told her in a pitiful voice, in half-sentences, what the wicked Shimen had told us. She didn&#8217;t quite understand and became impatient. Then she suddenly cried out: &#8220;What glowing Steindelach? Who took them into their mouth? Who doused themselves with hot water?&#8221; After a long discussion, she finally learned the real cause of our concern: She immediately sent for Shimen and energetically forbade him from talking such nonsense to us. She told us to wash ourselves and put on clean cotton dresses, then we would be worthy to receive our Kausses. In an instant, we were dressed. With triumphant expressions, we sprang into the dining room and now helped wipe the dishes.</p><p>Amidst these and similar tasks, half the day passed until our healthy stomachs reminded us that we had eaten nothing since 9 o&#8217;clock in the morning. We knew in advance what we would be given. They brought the large Gonscher <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[48]" id="pgepubid00058"><a id="Seite_48" title="[48]"/></span> (a very wide bottle) with sweet mead, which my mother knew how to cook so masterfully, and a full sieve of matzos: until this day, they had been kept in strict custody, as eating matzos before the holidays is not permitted for pious Jews. So they filled our Kausses with mead, and we set about the matzos. One piece after another was dipped in mead and quickly disappeared, crushed by our healthy teeth as if between millstones.</p><p>Mother finally came in from the kitchen. My older brother also appeared and brought apples, walnuts, and cinnamon. From these materials, he prepared, by crushing everything in a mortar, Charoset, i.e., a mass that looks like clay and comes to the Seder table in the evening. The &#8220;clay&#8221; is meant to remind us that our ancestors in Egypt kneaded bricks for Pharaoh.</p><p>After my brother had finished this work, Mother had the dining table carried into the yellow salon and set up to its full length in front of the sofa. She then covered it with a white damask tablecloth that reached down to the floor on both sides. Then she had the servant bring the porcelain and crystal dishes, arranged them, and went herself to the cabinet that contained all the silver dishes. The servant placed the cups and pitchers, which were very beautifully crafted, on the large silver tray. One pitcher, in particular, was especially artfully made with ivory inlays depicting mythological figures. The lid and the vessel were made of solid gold. My father had paid several hundred rubles for the artwork. Another rather large pitcher was made of hammered silver. Next to them stood large and small cups, the bottoms of which were French coins.</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[49]" id="pgepubid00059"><a id="Seite_49" title="[49]"/></span> Soon the fruit seller (Gereziche) also arrived with the fresh green salad, which played an important role that evening, the Seder evening. The servant brought from the kitchen a bowl full of hard-boiled eggs, a plate of freshly grated horseradish (called Moraur) &#8212; a symbol meant to recall the bitterness of the conditions under which our ancestors had lived in Egypt. Then some roasted pieces of meat, the so-called Zeroa, in memory of the Pesach Korban, i.e., the Passover sacrifice in the Temple in Jerusalem; furthermore, a plate with salt water and some Shmura Matzah (guarded matzos<a id="FNanchor_D_4"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="1084587126728857420_45488-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_D_4">[D]</a>). My mother covered all these dishes with a white cloth. Only the salad she left uncovered, as if it were meant to enliven the monotonous white of the tablecloth, while the red, sparkling wine in the crystal carafe reflected manifoldly in the brightly polished silver candlesticks and in every crystal glass. While my mother was busy setting the table and preparing the various small symbols for the evening celebration, Father often came and inquired if anything had been forgotten. To crown the work, Mother had some down pillows and a white piqué blanket brought and prepared a resting place for Father on the left, the so-called Hessebett<a id="FNanchor_E_5"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="1084587126728857420_45488-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_E_5">[E]</a>; a similar one was arranged on two chairs for the <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[50]" id="pgepubid00060"><a id="Seite_50" title="[50]"/></span> young men next to their seats. Every corner breathed cleanliness and comfort, and the festive atmosphere that prevailed in the house was shared by everyone.</p><p>The twilight slowly descended. Teatime approached. We drank and sipped the fragrant beverage with particular pleasure, for it tasted especially good in the festive surroundings. Everything sparkled and glittered. Even for drinking water, new vessels were in use.</p><p>Now it was time for grooming! It wasn&#8217;t long before my mother appeared, festively dressed, to light the candles. At the time I am describing, she was young and pretty. Her demeanor was modest yet self-assured. Her whole being, her eyes, expressed true, deep religiosity, calm, and peace of mind. She thanked the Creator for the grace that He had allowed her and her loved ones to experience this holiday in good health. &#8212; Her clothing was rich, like that of a patrician woman of those days. From her whole manner shone her noble, aristocratic lineage. Many of the younger generation will smile mockingly at the words &#8220;aristocratic lineage,&#8221; as if there were no Jewish nobility! Indeed, the Jew did not acquire his diploma of nobility on the battlefield or from royal palaces for heroic deeds on the great highway. Jewish nobility was given by spiritual life: living Talmud study, love for God and for people. And it often happened that external wealth and dignities also accompanied these virtues.</p><p>After my mother had lit the candles, she performed a short prayer, covering her eyes with both hands, as is the custom. On this occasion, <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[51]" id="pgepubid00061"><a id="Seite_51" title="[51]"/></span> we could admire the precious rings on her fingers, in which the candlelight glittered and shimmered in all the colors of the rainbow. One, in particular, remained in my memory, which had a large, yellow brilliant in the center, enclosed in an elongated shape by three rows of white brilliants.</p><p>Now my older, married sisters appeared in rich finery. In the 1840s, instead of the gold-embroidered, narrow skirt, a wide, pleated skirt was worn, which, however, had neither a hoop skirt nor a bustle, which disfigured the youthful body.<a id="FNanchor_F_6"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="1084587126728857420_45488-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_F_6">[F]</a> My four unmarried sisters, down to the very youngest, also wore jewelry.</p><p>We girls, already at the age of twelve, had the duty to light candles on the eve of holidays and Shabbat. So we all gathered around the table. We glowed with joyful anticipation of the Seder evening. All the candles burned. In front of Father&#8217;s seat, two Spirmazet candles burned, which were called &#8220;Manishtana&#8221; candles after the so-called four questions that the youngest child at the table asks. For lamps were not known at all at that time. In the 1840s, I still sat on long winter evenings with my sisters by a tallow candle, and we did our homework or read the exciting story of Prince Bowe with his faithful, spotted dog until late at night, without feeling the slightest discomfort. The nature of the tallow candle with its thick wick necessitated the frequent use of the snuffer, which today is to be regarded as an archaeological <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[52]"><a id="Seite_52" title="[52]"/></span> rarity. &#8212; Better illumination was achieved with Spirmazet candles or oil lamps. But both were only for the rich. The common citizen did not allow himself such luxury. Towards the end of the 1840s, the stearin candle appeared, which already gave a somewhat brighter light and pushed the tallow candle into the background. In the 1860s, with the spiritual enlightenment, also came the brightly burning kerosene lamp. That was a jubilation that the whole people in the country raised in joy about it. Everyone believed that with it, as with carriages, the last word for human comfort had been spoken. Everyone acquired lamps and had themselves instructed on how to handle them, how much kerosene to pour in, how wide, long, and thick the wick had to be. There was also a pair of scissors for this, but it was not the same as the candle snuffer. In the first few years after the introduction of lamps, even the candlesticks were completely abolished. &#8212; Even the peasants, for whom the pine splint<a id="FNanchor_G_7"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="1084587126728857420_45488-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_G_7">[G]</a> or Kahanez<a id="FNanchor_H_8"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="1084587126728857420_45488-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_H_8">[H]</a> had previously served as lighting, now acquired lamps. Although the light of the kerosene lamp of that time, with its yellowish-red flame, was harsh and unpleasant to the eye, the lamp factories nevertheless worked incessantly. Countless millions of poods of kerosene flowed into the Russian Empire. And the reign of the kerosene lamp lasted until the</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[53]" id="pgepubid00063"><a id="Seite_53" title="[53]"/></span></p><p>eighties, towards the end of which it was already being
displaced by gas: a new excitement among the population!
Of course, this invention served only the city for street lighting
and the rich for their homes. With a boastful
smile, the urban homeowner turned the tap for
gas lighting in his study to flood his guest from
the province with sudden brightness. In the
beginning, the new invention also cost many lives;
the street lighting pipes burst and were
leaky, and many suffocated in houses from escaping
gas if the gas taps were not tightly closed
during the night. Only much later did
electricity make its entrance and outshine the previous artificial lighting
with its brightness and convenience.</p><p>The Seder table gleamed and shone. The Meschores
(servant) wore a new caftan; his entire demeanor
exuded solemn self-confidence, as if he were serving this
evening out of kindness, graciousness, not out of duty,
as if he felt equal to the masters. He brought the
silver basin with the pitcher and many towels. The gentlemen
from the synagogue were expected and soon appeared.
As my father entered, we sensed a certain solemnity,
a comforting cheerfulness, in the tone with which he loudly said
&#8220;Gut Jom-Tow&#8221; (Good Holiday). He had
my brother bring all the Haggadahs<a id="FNanchor_I_9"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="1084587126728857420_45488-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_I_9">[I]</a> and blessed the
children. Thereupon we took our places at the table,
in order of age. Today,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[54]" id="pgepubid00064"><a id="Seite_54" title="[54]"/></span>
&#8220;Schimen, the Meschores,&#8221; was also allowed to sit at a corner of the table, in a
patriarchal manner, signifying that on this evening
all are equal &#8212; master and servant. My father&#8217;s appearance
was dignified; his large, intelligent eyes, his noble features
expressed an inner contentment and peace of mind.
His powerful, broad forehead testified to restless intellectual work.
His long, well-groomed beard completed his venerable,
patriarchal appearance, and his behavior towards the children, as well as
towards everyone else, inspired reverence, even though he was only forty years
old, as if he were an eighty-year-old elder.
My father was very mindful of his appearance, without being vain.
The seriousness of Jewish education protected against such
frivolity. His holiday attire consisted of a long black
satin caftan. It was trimmed lengthwise on both sides
with two velvet strips, next to which a row of small
black buttons was attached. The attire was completed by
an expensive fur-trimmed cap (called a Streimel)
and a broad satin belt around his waist. Only the collar of the fine
white linen shirt was visible, which advantageously
highlighted the luxurious black suit. The
red foulard handkerchief was also present. My older brothers-in-law
dressed like my father; my younger brother-in-law
already showed European fashion, wearing a black
velvet vest with a gold watch chain. My
eldest brother, a clever, bright child with large,
gray, dreamy eyes, though only twelve years old,
dressed like the older gentlemen. When making the
clothes, special care had to be taken because of &#8220;Shatnes.&#8221;
According to Jewish law, it is forbidden to wear wool fabrics
sewn with linen thread, and also to sit on
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[55]" id="pgepubid00065"><a id="Seite_55" title="[55]"/></span>
upholstered furniture, carriage seats covered with cloth
and sewn with threads. A fur sewn with
linen thread was not allowed to be covered with cloth. My
father&#8217;s furs were sewn with silk. Once,
the tailor was caught using linen thread,
and he had to unpick it piece by piece and sew everything back together
with cordonnet silk.</p><p>My father settled comfortably in his seat,
placed his magnificent snuffbox with the red foulard handkerchief
on the table to his right, and began to read from
the Haggadah. He asked my mother to hand him the individual
dishes from the plates; the younger
gentlemen also followed his example. Then my mother,
at my father&#8217;s special request, filled the cup with
red wine. The married sisters then also filled
their husbands&#8217; cups, while our older, unmarried
sister took on the task of pouring for us children and
the other table companions, including, of course, the
Meschores. Each of the gentlemen received three
Shmurah Matzahs on his plate, between which were already the Zeroa,
a little of the prepared horseradish, a little salad,
Charoset, a roasted egg, and a radish. All of
this was covered with a white napkin. My father took
the cup of wine in his right hand and recited the Kiddush prayer<a id="FNanchor_J_10"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="1084587126728857420_45488-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_J_10">[J]</a>
and emptied the glass. All table companions followed his
example after saying Amen. My mother
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[56]" id="pgepubid00065"><a id="Seite_56" title="[56]"/></span>
refilled the cup, the other women did the same for
their husbands, while the cups of the other table companions
were filled with sweet raisin wine. Then my
father took his place setting with all the items on it
in his right hand, lifted it up, and loudly recited
the chapter Ho Lachma Anya. The male table companions
repeated the sentence up to the second chapter
Mah Nishtanah, the so-called Four Questions, which the
youngest child at the table is to ask. These are: &#8220;Why
do we eat leavened and unleavened bread on all other nights of the year,
but tonight only unleavened?&#8221; etc. (see
Haggadah). My father answered, reading from
the Haggadah with an emotional voice: &#8220;Avadim Hayinu.&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;We were
slaves to Pharaoh in Mizraim, and had God the All-Good
in His omnipotence not redeemed us then, and had we not
departed from there, we, our children, and our children&#8217;s children would still
be slaves until now, and even if we were all wise scribes,
it is still our duty to tell of the Exodus
from Egypt.&#8221;</p><p>At these words, my father always burst into tears &#8212;
he could and certainly was allowed to thank his Creator with all his heart
when he let his gaze wander over the beautiful table round
and saw his young, pretty wife with the flourishing
children, who sat there richly adorned! He could
truly consider himself a prince compared to that time of slavery.</p><p>Now followed the Psalms, which are summarized
as the Hallel prayer, then, after frequent handwashing, the explanation
of why we eat the many bitter
herbs on this evening. It is in remembrance that our ancestors
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[57]" id="pgepubid00066"><a id="Seite_57" title="[57]"/></span>
were rich in bitterness, and that, wandering through the
desert, they had no other refreshment than bitter
herbs. Thereupon the gentlemen broke the middle of the three
matzahs in half, placed one half under the cushion for the
&#8220;Afikoman&#8221; (dessert), and distributed the other half
in small pieces among the table companions as &#8220;Matzah&#8221;
(the Jew prays before the first bite of bread, before every meal).
Then horseradish was eaten: first for Maror, which is
dipped in Charoset and swallowed as quickly as possible, as
this must be done without matzah. Then the Korech, again
a portion of horseradish placed between two pieces of matzah.
For each custom, a specific prayer is spoken beforehand.
In a word, on this evening, one truly felt the horseradish;
and we had to admit with tears in our eyes
that the lives of our ancestors in Egypt were bitter.
Later, radishes and eggs were dipped in salt water;
that tasted better, and finally, dinner came
which began with peppered fish, followed by a rich broth
with matzah meal dumplings, and ended with a fine fresh
vegetable. Then each table companion received a piece
 of the reserved Afikoman. Now the cups
were refilled with wine. Water was poured over the
hands, which is called &#8220;Mayim Acharonim&#8221; (last water),
during which a small prayer was recited; and now
one prepared to say the Grace After Meals, for which one
of the gentlemen at the table was usually honored as the prayer leader. At the end
of the prayer, the entire company at the table joined in with a loud
&#8220;Amen&#8221;; and after everyone had quietly recited the dessert prayer
for themselves, the cups were finally emptied. And now
the second part of the Haggadah began. For the fourth time,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[58]" id="pgepubid00067"><a id="Seite_58" title="[58]"/></span>
the cups were filled. This time, the large silver pitcher
was also filled, which was placed in the center of the table and was intended for the
Prophet Elijah. This custom finds its explanation in
Kabbalistic writings. According to Kabbalistic
teachings, everything one eats or drinks in even numbers
(so-called Kabbalistic Sugyot) is harmful or can at least
have a harmful effect. Therefore, at the Seder meal,
a fifth cup must be filled in addition to the four cups that are drunk.</p><p>We children firmly believed in the folk tale that the Prophet
Elijah would come in unseen and sip from the cup. We
therefore gazed intently at the pitcher, and when the
outermost layer on the surface moved slightly, we were
convinced that the Prophet was present, and we felt
a shiver of hot and cold. All the cups were filled, and my
father ordered the servant to open the door. Now one began
to recite the chapter &#8220;Shefoch Chamatcha&#8221;; this was followed by
the concluding chapters of the Hallel. And finally, the allegorical
song &#8220;Chad Gadya, Chad Gadya,&#8221; &#8220;One little goat, one little goat.&#8221;
With these and similar verses, the Seder evening came to its
conclusion. Everyone had drunk their fourth cup of wine.
On the faces of all table companions, one could see the exhaustion
and excitement due to the unaccustomed wine consumption. My
older and younger sisters left the table one after another
before the verses were finished singing, which
was not considered a violation of religion or household discipline.
But something held me back, something I didn&#8217;t want to miss for anything.
It was Shir HaShirim, the Song of Songs, the Song
of Solomon, of which I absorbed every word, every note with
my whole soul. The magnificent fusion of
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[59]" id="pgepubid00067"><a id="Seite_59" title="[59]"/></span>
tones and words had an intoxicating effect on the child&#8217;s mind;
I listened, enchanted. The entire song was sung in recitative in
seven tones, in which my older brother-in-law David
Ginsburg particularly excelled, and it has so vividly, so
unforgettably imprinted itself on my soul that I still know
the beginning by heart today, in my late evening of life.
What would I give to be able to hear that song
sung so beautifully just one more time in my life! My mother also
usually stayed at the table.</p><p>My mother then admonished me more than once to go
to bed. But I begged to be allowed to stay, which she permitted me for
a little while. However, when she noticed how tired
and exhausted I was, a second admonition followed, and
I repeated my earlier request even more earnestly. My
voice was probably so heartfelt that I received permission.
I tried hard not to seem tired and crawled
onto a large armchair standing in the corner and listened to the singing
with true spiritual delight. But I couldn&#8217;t last until the end,
and I only woke up in my bed when my Nanny
undressed me and tucked me in. I
woke up then, but soon fell asleep again in the most blissful
mood and awoke in the morning with the same joyful
and cheerful disposition. Everything in the house was festively decorated;
everywhere a solemn, wonderful Easter mood! Outside, the
spring sunshine radiated down from the clear sky. The
air was mild and warm. All of nature seemed to have put on a festive
dress, just like all of us in the house. Oh,
golden childhood in my parents&#8217; home, how beautiful you are! &#8212; &#8212; &#8212;</p><p>For tea, I received matzah and butter. I was dressed in a
new little dress, and I ran out to the neighbor children,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[60]" id="pgepubid00068"><a id="Seite_60" title="[60]"/></span>
who were already waiting for me in the meadow. We hopped and
danced and sang: &#8220;Spring is here, summer has come,
hooray! hooray! hooray! hooray!&#8221;</p><p>The women and men of the house had been in the
synagogue for services since early morning, where the prayer
for dew was recited today, a prayer that the
conservative Jewish people still fervently pray, even though
for almost 2000 years it has been outside the scope of their immediate
interests that the grain in the field may thrive through the
heavenly dew, the grass become juicy through the rich drops
of dew, the must succeed and not turn sour.
This prayer is thus continued according to ancient tradition,
and, like most Jewish prayers, half-sung, with
the women not sparing their tears.</p><p>A people, claimed Lord Beaconsfield, that twice
annually implores heaven for dew and rain for the fields,
will surely one day possess its own land again.</p><p>This shows how deeply the love for agriculture and the
soil runs in the blood of the Jews, for Jewish
law commands one to first plant a vineyard; to cultivate one&#8217;s field,
then to build a house, and only then to marry!</p><p>Around one o&#8217;clock, all synagogue-goers came home.
Guests had already arrived, making their Yom Tov &#8212;
(holiday) visits and were entertained with all sorts of sweets and
wine.</p><p>Lunch consisted of the four traditional
courses: the obligatory stuffed turkey neck, the most delicious
and best vegetables that the Easter season offered,
and of which a poor Jew could only dream on this holiday.
These rich, sweet dishes, to which were added the peppered fish
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[61]" id="pgepubid00069"><a id="Seite_61" title="[61]"/></span>
and the lavish dumplings, increased
thirst to the highest degree. Plenty of good,
old schnapps, red wine, and finally apple kvass were drunk.
After dinner, there was general snoring in all bedrooms,
kitchens, and in the hayloft, while we children
romped in complete freedom in the meadows and fields next to our house
and played for nuts with the neighbor children.
This absolute quiet in the house lasted
until six or seven o&#8217;clock. At this hour, tea is drunk.
After tea, the gentlemen went for a walk without their wives;
the women also went out into the fresh air with their friends,
and then one went to the synagogue for evening prayer,
but today began the counting of the Omer.<a id="FNanchor_K_11"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="1084587126728857420_45488-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_K_11">[K]</a></p><p>My mother did not go to the synagogue, because, as yesterday
on the eve, the Seder table had to be prepared.
This second evening also held a special
interest for us children. It was customary to keep the children awake in every way,
especially so that the youngest member of the family could still
ask the four Kashes (questions: why do we eat unleavened bread today,
etc.) according to the rule, and then,
to discuss the historical drama of the Exodus of the
Jews from Egypt more extensively than the Haggadah does, with
the older and younger household members. We were
given apples and nuts to play with. We were very cheerful
and stayed awake until the end of the Seder. The table
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[62]" id="pgepubid00070"><a id="Seite_62" title="[62]"/></span>
was richly set, just like yesterday. But some dishes &#8212; especially
the salad &#8212; bore the character of being tired, wilted.
Only the freshly grated horseradish spread its sharp
fragrance.</p><p>At this second Seder celebration, one no longer waited with
impatience, as at the first, for dinner, because everyone was still
full from the lavish midday meal. Dinner
was not ready until around ten o&#8217;clock in the evening, as nothing
could be cooked during the day and the preparation of
dinner only began with the onset of darkness,
when stars were visible in the sky. It consisted merely of a
broth or a borscht (soup made from red beets)
and boiled poultry. There was no roast, because
the Zeroa, the symbol of the burnt offering, stood on the table.
My father usually asked impatiently for the food that evening,
as the Afikoman had to be eaten and the Seder celebration concluded
before midnight. The details were the same as on the previous evening,
even if they followed each other less solemnly and more quickly;
and at this pace, it was also possible to eat the Afikoman
before midnight. After the conclusion of the second half of the
Seder, the Song of Songs was sung again until well past midnight,
which I listened to sitting upright until the end.</p><p>The following four days are called Chol HaMoed (weekdays,
semi-holidays, on which life flows almost like on an ordinary
day and almost everything is permitted). In our
house, however, life was similar to that on ordinary holidays:
many guests came for tea, lunch, and dinner.</p><p>Much effort was involved in guarding the Shmurah, the matzahs,
and the vessels. More than once there was trouble with the servants,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[63]" id="pgepubid00071"><a id="Seite_63" title="[63]"/></span>
who often mixed up the dishes. I remember one
instance: it was on Erev Yom Tov (the eve of the holiday) of the last
two days of the Passover festival. A considerable number of
chickens and &#8220;Indians&#8221; (turkeys) lay koshered, i.e.,
soaked and salted according to ritual prescription, when my
mother appeared in the kitchen, took a large knife, and examined
whether perhaps an oat or barley grain, with which the
poultry had been fattened, had gotten stuck somewhere
as Chametz, so that the poultry would be unusable
for Passover. And indeed! She found an oat grain in the throat of an
&#8220;Indian bird,&#8221; by which all its fellow sufferers were now judged,
i.e., they were Chametz and could no longer be used.
My mother was very annoyed about this, looked at the
cook with reproachful glances and a triumphant expression,
and exclaimed: &#8220;There you have it, you clumsy
thing! Where were your eyes? You were probably
blind when koshering the poultry? You wouldn&#8217;t have
noticed it even now. I thank God for the grace that
I found the oat grain, otherwise you would have fed
all of us Chametz!&#8221;</p><p>Effort and expense had now been in vain; all the
poultry was discarded, and other poultry had to be slaughtered,
cleaned, and koshered! Imagine the
annoyance of the mother and housewife! The day was advanced,
mealtime was near! Nevertheless, her
annoyance was mitigated by a feeling of joyful satisfaction, because God had
preserved her from a sin. For the strict observance of all
Passover regulations is all the more significant for the devout Jew,
as their violation is said to be punished with premature death.
Thus, the death sentence was carried out on just as many chickens
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[64]" id="pgepubid00072"><a id="Seite_64" title="[64]"/></span>
and turkeys, although they protested loudly against it in the yard!</p><p>It also happened once during these days that the servant
gave the cook an ordinary matzah instead of Shmurah Matzah
for cooking fish. A quarter of an hour before dinner, my
mother arranged the deliciously cooked fish on the platter
and recognized the mistake. My mother became angry and
annoyed, and the servant received his well-deserved reproaches.
The incident filled the whole house with noise and
righteous fury; and neither the parents nor the Melamed touched
the appetizing fish! The father, the mother,
and the Melamed ate only from the Shmurah Matzahs, and also had
special dishes, while the other household members consumed the
ordinary matzahs.</p><p>Now came the last day of the Passover festival. The eight-day
torment with the food, the meal preparations, which one had endured
so patiently and piously in our parents&#8217; home,
was over. In the twilight hour of the last day, the boys
in the synagogue courtyard had fun and shouted:
&#8220;Come to the Chametz-filled <em class="gesperrt">Barchu</em>!&#8221; (The first word of the
evening prayer.)</p><p>My father came home from the synagogue and, standing at the
dining table, performed Havdalah, i.e., he consecrated the coming weekdays
with a cup of wine and thanked God for having
separated festival day and weekday, light and darkness.
At the end of the prayer, he emptied the cup,
poured the remainder onto the table, after smelling the fragrant box
filled with cloves, holding his fingers against the braided,
burning small wax candle and letting the light shine through,
and then extinguished the light in the remaining wine.</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[65]" id="pgepubid00073"><a id="Seite_65" title="[65]"/></span></p><p>Then one was free from all the constraint that the Passover festival, despite all its splendors, imposed, and the spring with its joys, the merry outdoor games, began for us children its own beginning. At home there was still a long time of work before the Passover dishes down to the last pot and the last bowl were gathered from all corners and nooks and set aside again. Schimen, the Meschores, brought down in the evenings the large chests from the floor and packed everything away, so that on the following day no trace of the Passover, which had been prepared with so much care, remained to be seen. Even the remaining Matzos were not allowed to be eaten according to the regulations; in some Jewish homes they used to fasten a single, large, round Matzoh to the wall by a string, which hung all year until the next Passover as a reminder. Right after the festival the various kinds of grains were examined to see whether worms might have developed during the eight-day "shutdown", since it was already very hot in our region at that time. In our house, of course, the previous year’s grain ("yoshon") was no longer eaten. We waited until fresh grain appeared — "chodosh"</p>
<p>The first weeks of spring in our house were marked by the somber atmosphere of Sefira (from Pesach to Shavuos), during which all joy and play were forbidden. Attending concerts and the theater, celebrating a wedding, or even just wearing a new dress or shoes, or even taking a dip in the river in the oppressive heat, was strictly forbidden in my parents' home. Only on Fridays, after half the day had passed, was one allowed a warm cleansing bath. All jewelry, such as strings of pearls and the embroidered headband, was put away. People wore simple, old, worn clothes. During Sefira, my parents and siblings, contrary to their usual habits, refrained from all jokes and almost never laughed or joked. My mother often promised us many nuts if we reminded her to count the Sphire each evening. Reminders were unnecessary, however, as she never forgot to count how many days and weeks had passed during Sefira. — — —</p>
<p>The first weeks of spring held a special appeal for me. The meadows near our house tempted me. All morning I would leap about in the merriest mood, picking one buttercup after another and rejoicing at every young bloom. I wandered with the help of my constant companion Chaie, the plumber’s daughter, weaving garlands from these meadow flowers, for which I still gathered many delicate forget-me-nots from the bank of the nearby river. We crowned our heads with the garlands and walked home thus adorned. Often, in the company of poor neighboring children, I undertook excursions into the shrubs that surrounded the tall mountain beside our house, which held countless bright red wild berries. From these we made long strings and wore them as ornaments. On these excursions I often forgot to return home, and my mother grew anxious and worried about me. Everyone was already at table, and I had not yet come home, and they had to search for me.</p>
<p>One of my favorite places was the lonely hayloft, where fragrant young hay lay piled high. I would dig myself a kind of den there and sit inside. Here <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[67]" id="pgepubid00075"><a id="Seite_67" title="[67]"/></span> I would play with my favorite kitten, teach it to stand and sit on its hind legs, wrap it in my apron, pull its ear, and shout into it, "Little kitten, do you want porridge?" And the tortured little creature would tear its ear from my hand, shake itself, which I took as "no"; then I would take its other ear and shout into it, "Perhaps you'd like some kugel?" And the kitten would let out a loud meow, which I took as "yes." But I couldn't stay at this game for long. I would lean over the boards and throw piles of hay through the large openings into the stable, right in front of the horses' heads, which they greedily devoured.</p>
<p>To put an end to my slovenliness and my rambling about in the mountains, through fields and bushes, and my dangerous squatting in the hayloft, my mother decided to enroll me in cheder (elementary school) and entrust me to the melamed (elementary school teacher) with whom my older sister was receiving Hebrew lessons.</p>
<p>One beautiful afternoon, in the midst of playing so enthusiastically, I was suddenly called into the dining room by my mother, who was standing at the window. There, already waiting for me, sat Reb Leser, the melamed (teacher), and my mother said to him, “This is my Pessele; tomorrow she and Chaveleben (my sister) will be coming to your cheder.” In my shyness, I hardly dared to look up at him. “But you mustn’t bring your kitten to cheder,” Reb Leser told me. These words did little to win me over. The novelty of the visit to the cheder had been half-swept away. I sat there dejectedly, wondering what would become of my kitten and all the other treasures. I heard Reb Leser say to my mother, "Well, the assistant will pick her up for the cheder on Tuesday." He wished me "good night" and disappeared into the twilight. And now it was time to say goodbye to the fun games with Chaie, the plumber's daughter, who used to bring such pretty little pots, with Peyke, who was so inventive with her puppets, and Jentke—how often we sat there, at the end of the long garden fence, on the big wooden block, so cozy together, telling each other sad and happy fairy tales that we either wept bitterly or laughed heartily! It broke my heart to have to give it all up. Only my curiosity to see the scene of my new life offered me a little comfort. My mother advised me to go to bed soon after dinner so I could get up at the same time as my sister early in the morning and go to cheder together. My sleep wasn't as restful that night as usual! I was even up earlier than my sister. The nanny had to wash and dress me first, and I even had to wait for my sister.</p>
<p>The first day of school!....</p>
<p>The "assistant" appeared to pick us up. I was very curious to see him. He was a tall boy with two long, thin, blond curls in front of his large, donkey-like ears and an incredibly wide mouth. His eyes were rarely visible, as he wore his padded kutchma<a id="FNanchor_L_12"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="1084587126728857420_45488-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_L_12">[L]</a>, which he had pressed down onto his forehead even in the sweltering heat, as if it were permanently attached to his head. His other clothing was hardly luxurious either. One shoe was so large that it fell off with every step, while the other was so small that he had to drag his other leg behind him with a limp; apparently, the two shoes belonged to different pairs. He was from the village of Sabludewe (meaning backwater) and his name was Velvel. I learned all this when he entered the kitchen, and I curiously poked my head into the half-open door. He was just about to have his breakfast; He ate with us "days," as they were called back then, meaning he ate at a different student's parents' house every day of the week. He came to our house every Tuesday. I used to laugh at him. He was so funny, though, when this tall man would clumsily sit down on the very edge of the kitchen bench, so that the other end lifted up and he, the boy, would tumble awkwardly onto the floor. Even our grumpy cook had to laugh. The mishap, however, didn't stop our helper from devouring his meal with a ravenous appetite. Then our companion blessed our first cheder walk by exclaiming, "Now with your right foot!" On the way, he usually brought up the rear guard, probably because of his mismatched footwear. But he would soon prove himself to be our valiant protector.</p>
<p>The opportunity for this came in the form of an angry dog that attacked us and chased us. Desperately we looked around for our protector—but the first one to cry out miserably was he. Despite his shoes he ran as fast as he could, we tried to follow him, but he was the better runner — we could not reach him. My sister seized my hand and, in breathless fear, we repeated the little rhyme, like a prayer:</p><div class="center">



<div class="poem" style="display: inline-block;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">»Hintale (Little Dog), Hintale, do you want to bite me?<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Three little devils will come,<br/></span>

</div>
</div><p>The verse had to be spoken quickly, in one breath and without moving from the spot. We were firmly convinced that the dog would quiet down and let us pass....</p><p>Unser »bewährter« Führer wartete auf seinem Platze, wo er sich in Sicherheit fühlte, so lange, bis wir zu ihm kamen. Und nun bewegte sich der Zug weiter. Meine Schwester zeigte und erklärte mir auf dem Wege alles, was mir neu und merkwürdig schien. Wir sahen viele Buden, Krämergestelle und mußten uns durch die Menschenmassen hindurchdrängen, bis wir gegen acht Uhr den Cheder erreichten.</p><p>The little house had once, long, long ago, been yellow, but now stood deep in the earth with small window panes that let in daylight only sparingly. The house was surrounded by a Prisbe (earth bank), on which I saw my future classmates, who were about the same age as me and my elder sister, playing various games. They gawked at me with big eyes. We stood in front of the entrance door. So easily could a stranger not find his way here! My sister went ahead; she opened the door, sprang into the hallway, and held out her hand to me. I seized it and stretched out one leg to find ground. This ground was a half-rotted piece of wood, sunk deep into the clay soil. I had to stretch my leg far from me to feel the wood. I now set down the second leg and bravely took a step forward. My sister warned me not to stumble on the ladder leading to the ground. One more step and there stood a water barrel, at the rim of which lay the large wooden dipper that would later urge us children to drink. There was also a bucket and a broom here. To the left I saw a door that, instead of a doorknob, had a wooden stick, so smooth from use as if glazed. My sister opened the door, she entered the classroom, and I followed her. We could not stand up straight comfortably. With the first step we bumped into a bench that, with a long wooden table, was almost connected, on which lay various teaching and prayer books. On the other side of the table stood a similar bench that reached to the wall. I leave it to the reader’s imagination to gauge the width of this room! Reb Leser, the Melamed, sat at the head of the table, from where he could overlook the whole area with an empire-like gaze.</p><p>Reb Leser was stoutly built, broad-shouldered, and with his massive form he blocked the window next to which he sat, in his full width and height. His water-blue, large, protruding eyes, before which moved constantly a couple of small gray Pees (earrings), and his long face with the pointed gray beard betrayed self-confidence and pride. The forehead with the strong, swollen veins testified to energy. His attire was timely and appropriate to his rank: short, knee-breeches, gray thick stockings, gigantic shoes; his shirt sleeves were of dubious cleanliness; a long, colorful, dark Arbakanfos<a id="FNanchor_M_13"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="1084587126728857420_45488-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_M_13">[M]</a> of calico replaced the coat in summer (in winter he wore a padded coat). The small black velvet cap on his large head completed the then-fashionable dress of his rank.</p><p>Am anderen Ende des Tisches saß, stets in gebückter Haltung, der Ober-Behelfer. Er hielt einen langen schmalen Holzstift in den Händen (das Deitelholz genannt), womit er den Kindern beim Lesen Buchstaben für Buchstaben, Zeile für Zeile zeigte. Er hatte die Aufgabe, das vom Rebben Vorgetragene mit den Schülerinnen zu wiederholen. Er war immer ernst, hatte eine Nase von der Form eines Spatens, kleine, melancholische Augen und vor den Ohren zwei lange, schwarze Pees, die in steter Bewegung waren.</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[73]" id="pgepubid00081"><a id="Seite_73" title="[73]"/></span></p><p>Wir blieben also stehen, wir <em class="gesperrt">mußten</em> auf demselben Fleck stehen bleiben. Der Rebbe erhob sich, als er mich erblickte mit dem Ausruf: »Ah!« Dann faßte er mich unter die Arme, hob mich auf die Bank und setzte mich neben sich hin. Die Schülerinnen kamen inzwischen hereingelaufen, um mich, das neuangekommene Wundertier, zu sehen und Bemerkungen auszutauschen. Meine Schwester, die bereits heimisch war, suchte ihren Platz auf, blickte aber wie schützend zu mir hin. Angst, Befangenheit, die vielen fremden Gesichter, die dumpfe Luft in der Stube, die niedrige Decke, zu der ich fortwährend ängstlich hinaufsah, das alles und wahrscheinlich noch die Nachwirkung des Schreckens durch den wütenden Hund, schnürten mir die Kehle zu, und ich wußte nichts Besseres anzufangen, als plötzlich heftig und bitterlich zu weinen. Ich schämte mich und machte mir im stillen Vorwürfe, allein ich konnte mich nicht beherrschen. Reb Leser suchte mich zu beruhigen, indem er mir versprach, daß heute noch nicht mit dem Unterricht begonnen wurde. Ich könne mit den Schülerinnen in der Ruhepause spielen. Aber je mehr er mir zusprach, desto reichlicher flossen meine Tränen. Der Rebbe erriet endlich, daß es die vielen neugierigen Augen waren, die mich schreckten, und er stampfte mit seinen großen Füßen auf, daß alles erbebte und er schrie: »Hinaus, auf die Gasse, Schickses!<a id="FNanchor_N_14"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="1084587126728857420_45488-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_N_14">[N]</a> Was gafft Ihr, habt Ihr so etwas noch nicht gesehen?« Auf diesen Befehl zerstoben sie nach allen Richtungen und nahmen schließlich ihre Spiele auf der Prisbe auf. Ich ward ruhiger, wagte aber nicht, mich von der Stelle zu rühren. Meine Schwester nahm einen Absatz mit dem Rebben durch, wiederholte ihn mit dem Ober-Behelfer und wollte dann auch zum Spiel hinausgehen und mich mitnehmen. Ich aber ließ mich dazu nicht bereden. Nach einer Weile hörte ich, daß unser ritterlicher Begleiter Welwel vermißt und mit Ungeduld erwartet wurde, da er für fast alle Schülerinnen das Mittagessen holte. Ich war zu sehr mit mir und der neuen Sphäre beschäftigt und hatte gar nicht daran gedacht, wo und wann wir zu Mittag essen würden. Der sehnlichst Erwartete kam endlich und ein seltenes Bild bot sich mir: Welwel trug Krüge, Töpfe, Schüsselchen, Gläser, Löffel verschiedener Gattungen und Größen, Brot und Speisen in folgender Anordnung: die Töpfe und Krüge waren an seinem langen breiten Gürtel, fest um den Leib gebunden und reichten bis weit über die Hüfte. Das Brot plazierte der erfinderische Bocher auf der Brust zwischen dem Hemd und dem Kaftan, die gefüllten Schüsselchen hatte er übereinander gestellt, drückte sie auf dem Arm gegen die Brust recht fest und hielt sie mit der anderen freien Hand. Das Dessert, das aus Nüssen, Äpfeln, gekochten Bohnen und Erbsen bestand, verwahrte er in seinen langen Diebstaschen. So ausgerüstet, bewegte sich »das Schiff der Stadt« langsam seinem Ziele, dem Cheder, entgegen. Es war ihm tatsächlich nicht möglich, sich irgendwo hinzusetzen.</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[74]" id="pgepubid00082"><a id="Seite_74" title="[74]"/></span></p><p>Endlich war er da! Der Rebbe schalt ihn wegen seiner Saumseligkeit, worauf er klagend erzählte, wo und wie lange er auf das Essen hatte warten müssen. »Gib geschwind die zinnernen Schüsseln und die Blechlöffel her«, befahl nun der Rebbe und schleunigst wurde der Befehl ausgeführt. Der Rebbe schüttete unser Mittagsessen in eine Schüssel, und ich bekam einen Blechlöffel, der am Ende des Stieles ein kleines Loch hatte, was bedeuten sollte, daß er »milchig« war, d. h. nur für Milchspeisen benutzt werden durfte. Ich drehte den Löffel mehrere Male in den Händen hin und her und konnte mich nicht entschließen, damit aus der Schüssel zu schöpfen. Ich dachte bei mir: Wie, nicht aus meinem weißen Porzellanteller und mit diesem blechernen Löffel soll ich essen? Wieder kamen mir die Tränen in die Augen, und der Hals war mir wie zugeschnürt. Der Rebbe sah mich verwundert an und konnte sich diesmal den Grund meiner Tränen nicht erklären! Meine Schwester aber war praktischer als ich (und diesen Vorzug mir gegenüber behielt sie durch das ganze Leben). Sie griff tüchtig zu, führte einen Löffel nach dem andern zum Mund und ließ sichs gut schmecken. Als sie einigermaßen satt war, fragte sie mich verwundert, warum ich nicht esse. Ich blieb ihr die Antwort schuldig, denn ich fühlte, daß mir bei den ersten Worten die Tränen noch wilder aus den Augen stürzen mußten. Ich bezwang mich aber und schöpfte einen Löffel voll, dessen Inhalt ich zusammen mit meinen Tränen verschluckte. Nach Beendeter Mahlzeit hob mich der Rebbe von der Bank, und ich begann, wiewohl der Verlauf des Mittagessens mich gekränkt hatte, in meinem kindlichen Sinn alle Vorzüge des Essens im Cheder, im Vergleich zu dem Mittagsbrot zu Hause, herauszusuchen. Hier durften wir während der Mahlzeit nach Belieben sprechen und trinken, was zu Hause erst nach dem Braten gestattet war. Hier durften wir uns vom Tisch erheben, wann wir wollten, zu Hause erst, nachdem der Vater aufgestanden war. Als ich nach dem Essen wieder trinken wollte, machte man mich auf den großen Holzschöpfer auf dem Wasserfaß aufmerksam, den ich benutzen sollte. Dann nahm mich meine Schwester an der einen Hand, eine Schülerin an der zweiten und in ihrer Mitte erschien ich endlich auf der Gasse und beteiligte mich an den Spielen. Das dauerte bis sieben Uhr abends. Da wurden wir in das Cheder-Lokal zusammenberufen, um das Abendgebet zu verrichten. Der Behelfer stand in der Mitte. Wir um ihn geschart. Unsere Augen auf ihn gerichtet, sagten wir ihm jedes vorgesprochene Wort nach, dann ging es rasch nach Hause.</p><p>I came back from the day’s experiences so worn out that I could tell my Njanja little. I drank my tea and fell asleep without supper. But I woke the next morning with a certain impatience and with a vivid longing that the Cheder helper might come as quickly as possible, so that I could see again the faces that yesterday had seemed so embarrassing to me. But more than anything I longed to continue the interrupted games. Welwel, the brave guide, also appeared punctually, and this time we reached the Cheder without incident.</p><p>Und nun benahm ich mich auch schon anders.</p><p>Ich lernte zum erstenmal mit meinem Rebben, später spielte ich mit den anderen Schülerinnen. Es verging kaum eine Woche, da fühlte ich mich schon sehr behaglich und kannte jeden Schlupfwinkel in der Schule.</p><p>Besides the long, narrow study room, there was also a
long, dark passageway, &#8212; any other description
would be incorrect &#8212; in which the bed frame of the
Rabbi and that of his Rebbezin were located. In front of the beds hung
on two thick ropes stretched over a beam,
the cradle in which their only daughter Altinke lay; anyone
who wanted to go to the third room inevitably bumped against
this cradle, which then remained in motion for a long time. This
room, as well as the bed and cradle linen, were by no means
to be called clean. But one must be content with everything,
it is said, and the inhabitants of this dilapidated hut were so
in the fullest sense of the word. They asked for nothing more. Their
only concern was that their &#8220;Altinke&#8221; (although already 2 years
old, the child could not yet stand upright) remained the only one
of four children alive. They guarded and cared for
her and protected her like the apple of their eye. Around her neck, she wore various
amulets: a M&#8217;susele<a id="FNanchor_O_15"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="1084587126728857420_45488-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_O_15">[O]</a> and a Heele (also a
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[77]" id="pgepubid00085"><a id="Seite_77" title="[77]"/></span>
type of amulet, cast from lead, with a mystical
inscription). The ribbon from which these things
and also a wolf&#8217;s tooth hung, stuck to the child&#8217;s
padded bodice due to constant
dampness from saliva and dirt. This small, unfortunate
creature mostly lay in the cradle, as Feige, as the Rebbezin was called,
had to conduct all sorts of business on her own, such as baking honey cakes
with warm cabbage, cooking peas and beans,
delicacies that the schoolgirls bought from her daily. Especially
it was the brooding hen with her chicks that
gave her a lot of trouble. Of course, there was little
time during this work to carry the child around in her arms. Daily she chose
another of the schoolgirls to help her in all household
matters; thus, she discovered in me
an obedient, willing helper. Soon I rocked her child
(which I, by the way, did with great pleasure), soon I helped
her to sprinkle the shovel with flour when she had to
put the bread into the oven; soon I looked under the sieves for
freshly laid eggs (with which, when they were still quite
warm, I liked to rub over my eyes).</p><p>The Rebbezin&#8217;s figure was reminiscent of a hop pole;
she had unusually long arms, a long, thin neck
that carried a horse&#8217;s head, small, wandering eyes, bony
cheeks, and blue, thin lips that probably hadn&#8217;t
curled into a smile since childhood. Her long
hawk nose half-covered her mouth and gave her
face the expression of a bird of prey. Her long horse-like teeth
and, above all, the gaps between her teeth, made the words
from her mouth not sound very pleasant. But that did not prevent
her from convincing her entire surroundings from early morning
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[78]" id="pgepubid00086"><a id="Seite_78" title="[78]"/></span>
until late evening of the existence of her unweakened
vocal organ. I, too, would soon
learn that the Rebbezin was not to be trifled with, and a
gesture from her did not suggest a very gentle nature. I had had to leave my
kitten at home, which I got over at first because I found
a substitute in the Rebbezin&#8217;s chickens. I often went to the Pripoczok (oven, lower
part), to the brooding hen, and watched how she sat gently
on the eggs with outstretched wings. Her eye expressed
almost human tenderness during this time. The animal sat
patiently without food and waited until she was taken down
and fed. So it happened once that I bent down to the brooding hen
to carry her away and feed her. The Rebbezin
saw me from her seat and was alarmed at the possibility
that I might scare the hen away and that she might
eventually fly off. The eggs would get cold and could no longer
be hatched. Feige quickly jumped to me, grabbed
my shoulder somewhat roughly, and screamed at the top of her lungs:
&#8220;What are you doing? What do you want? Crazy one, get away!&#8221;
(away from here). I looked up at the Rebbezin, who was panting with rage.
The hen indeed broke free from my hands and
flew rapidly in the direction where Reb Leser
was enthroned; next to him, in the corner, was a small triangular
shelf, on which the hen settled, looked around with loud
clucking, as if she liked it there, then went onto
Reb Leser&#8217;s head, crouched down, and left a souvenir
of her brief stay; then she flew, flapping her
wings, onto the shelf where the pewter plates and bowls
stood, knocked everything over, which naturally made a lot of noise, and
sought her hole under the Pripoczok, where she
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[79]"><a id="Seite_79" title="[79]"/></span>
finally calmed down. Reb Leser, however, could not calm down
so quickly; when the students sitting around the table
pointed at his head with loud laughter, he grabbed
his head covering, and, full of rage, had to wipe away the
leftover souvenir, he scolded and cursed in a loud
voice. He swore to his wife, high and mighty, that he would
slaughter all her chickens. That was even supposed to happen tomorrow.
But our undaunted Rebbezin thought differently
about it and defended her protégés at the open door. She
presented arguments that identified me as the main culprit in the
accident. Finally, she said that her husband had
no right at all to condemn the chickens to death.
Her brilliant defense speech had probably been sufficiently energetic,
as Reb Leser lost the argument and was silenced.
Thus, he transformed the death sentence into a
pardon. This incident provided much material for conversations
in the Cheder and in the so-called &#8220;Schmolen Gässel&#8221; (narrow
alley). Many spectators had gathered,
who looked in through the windows and were almost drawn
into the fight. That evening I had a lot to tell my Nanny....</p><p>If Reb Leser had finally left his wife&#8217;s remarks
unanswered, he did so with the self-confidence
of a man whose dignity, despite everything, was undeniable.
He also had every reason to, for he was not only
in his house, in the school alley, and in the narrow alley,
but also further afield on the island of Kempe, beyond the pond,
very popular! People came to Reb Leser, the Melamed, when
a child fell ill, had a fever. He knew how to heal and to
charm away an &#8220;Ajin hora&#8221; (evil eye, gaze). For
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[80]" id="pgepubid00087"><a id="Seite_80" title="[80]"/></span>
this purpose, he took a piece of clothing from the &#8220;afflicted one,&#8221; perhaps a
small stocking or a vest, whispered a mysterious
spell, and spat on it three times. That was enough to make the child
recover, without him having seen it personally.
The items were returned to the bearer with the words:
&#8220;It will get well.&#8221; If someone had
a toothache, Reb Leser would place him in the moonlight
exactly at midnight against the moon and stroked his
right cheek, then his left, while murmuring mystical words.
And Reb Leser was then sure that the pain
would stop &#8212; possibly, of course, only after a long time or
after the tooth had been pulled. Whoever suffered from severe back pain
had to lie down on the floorboards; Reb Leser,
the B&#8217;hor (firstborn), stood with one foot on the
patient&#8217;s back for a moment, and the patient
was cured!</p><p>If someone wanted to buy a cow, he was firmly convinced
that it would give a lot of milk if Reb Leser had ostensibly
set the purchase price after long haggling. A
word from Reb Leser&#8217;s lips could achieve much.</p><p>These were the small sources of his income; in contrast,
the matchmaking business brought him much more money. This
activity brought him almost as much as his school and also had
the advantage that it usually took place over a small glass
of schnapps. Depending on the success of a match,
his friends and &#8212; enemies multiplied. There were more of the latter!&#8230; Reb Leser
didn&#8217;t let it give him gray hairs. All matches were equally good to him.
He conducted this business in his leisure hours between Mincha and Maariv
on Saturday evening, as the Jew of that time, after he had
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[81]" id="pgepubid00088"><a id="Seite_81" title="[81]"/></span>
rested for twenty-four hours, was in the right mood
to talk about such things. It was perhaps good
that Reb Leser could spend so little time on this matter....</p><p>The memorable incident with the hen was enough
to make me dislike the interior of the Cheder and to make me more interested in the
games outside. I achieved great skill in some &#8212;
for example, in the game of signs, using a
type of primitively made dice from bones; in the
nut game and in the odd and even pin game. One
of my friends was very skilled in the pin game
and aroused my envy: she could hold a lot of pins
under her tongue in her mouth and speak unhindered.</p><p>So much was played that we children often forgot the actual
purpose of our school attendance.</p><p>I soon became familiar with the entire surroundings of the Cheder premises
and was on good terms with the neighborhood.
My special favorite was the little synagogue caller, a
thin, stooped man with a greenish-yellow goat-like face
and dull goat-like eyes that had the look of one tormented.
His whole life he seemed to suffer from whooping cough.
When we children saw him in the alley, we ran
towards him and shouted exuberantly: &#8220;To shul! To shul!&#8221;
and accompanied him for a while. He appeared before the
morning and evening prayers in the school alley and, shouting with all
his remaining lung power: &#8220;To shul! To shul!&#8221;, called
the community together. Then he put his hands on his hips
and could not catch his breath for a long time due to coughing.
Incidentally, he had another
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[82]" id="pgepubid00089"><a id="Seite_82" title="[82]"/></span>
occupation; every Friday, shortly before the beginning of the
Sabbath festival, he ran to the Jewish merchants and admonished them
to close their shops quickly. And before New Year, he woke
the community at dawn for Slichot (morning prayer during
the entire week before the New Year festival).</p><p>The small, low Cheder room could not accommodate all the schoolgirls,
and outside the door, the scorching
heat of the sun often drove us away; so we had to flee
with our dice and nut games into one of the many small antechambers
in the large synagogue opposite the Cheder, where it was always
cool and spacious. I remember that I never dared
to go further than the antechamber and what a tremendous impression
I had when my playmates once forced me to
enter the section where the men used to pray.
The large room with its many benches and tables was
imposing. In the middle of the synagogue was a square
raised platform, surrounded by a low, carved railing;
on this elevation stood a narrow, high table on which the Torah scrolls
lay during the &#8220;Leining.&#8221; In the
background was a high gate, whose two doors led to the
Aron Kodesh. This holy ark was covered with a
red velvet curtain, in the middle of which the Magen David symbol
was woven. On both sides of this Jewish
banner stood two life-size lions made of bronze metal
in an upright position, as if standing guard. On the
eastern wall, the Mizrach wall, were the places of honor
for the oldest and most respected Jews of the city of Brest.
There was also the &#8220;Matan b&#8217;sseisser Puschke,&#8221; i.e., the
box of secret gifts. If someone&#8217;s favorite wish
had come true or a special good fortune
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[83]" id="pgepubid00090"><a id="Seite_83" title="[83]"/></span>
had befallen them, about which they did not want to speak to anyone,
they secretly donated something to this box. Outside,
only a small slit in a niche of the wall was visible.
Into this opening, the donors threw their secret gift, not
without first anxiously making sure that no one
was observing them. From the sky-blue ceiling of the synagogue, painted with silver stars,
numerous chandeliers hung on chains. All this strange splendor
filled the child&#8217;s mind with reverence and awe.</p><p>My companions told me, whispering mysteriously,
that behind the high doors of the Aron Kodesh was a
cabinet with many Sefer Torahs (holy scrolls) and
that from there an underground passage led to Jerusalem.
On Friday evening, the Resha&#8217;im (sinners) freed from Gehenna (Hell)
gathered to play all sorts of mischief.
Other similar tales increased my anxious awe.
The tale of the &#8220;clay Golem&#8221; (clay figure) particularly affected me:
on the Aron Kodesh in the synagogue
there lies a large figure made of clay, which once could perform all the actions
of a living human. The old Kabbalists
used such clay figures, which they provided with amulets,
hieroglyphs, and other signs known to no one,
and whispered magic formulas into the ears of the clay figures,
so that they began to stir and could perform all sorts of services
like a human. Everything this figure was supposed to do had
to be specified to it in detail and precisely, e.g.:
&#8220;Go to the door, grasp the handle, push it down, open the
door, close it, go into the house on that street, push
the handle down, open the door, close it, go
into the first room, go to the table where my friend is sitting,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[84]" id="pgepubid00091"><a id="Seite_84" title="[84]"/></span>
tell him to come to me with the book today.&#8221; The
return path also had to be described to the figure step by step exactly,
otherwise the Golem (the clay figure) was capable of
carrying the entire house where the friend lived on its shoulders.
He was just a simpleton; and even today, among the
Jewish people, the term: &#8220;You are a clay Golem&#8221;
is an insult.</p><p>Only once more did I dare to enter the large
room alone, but I ran away, seized by an eerie shiver,
crying and screaming, and Reb Leser forbade me
to go there again without accompaniment.</p><p>I can still see in my mind&#8217;s eye the beautiful, majestic
building in old Moorish style with the round glass tower, through
whose panes daylight fell and illuminated the interior of the
synagogue.</p><p class="pmb3 pmb2">When the city of Brest was demolished and converted into a fortress
in 1836, the synagogue also had to be torn down,
and the cornerstone that was found pointed back to earlier
centuries, to the days of Saul Wahl, who had been elected king
for one night by the warring Polish parties.
Wahl had built the synagogue in memory
of his deceased wife Deborah.</p><hr class="chap"/><p class="break"/><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[85]" id="pgepubid00092"><a id="Seite_85" title="[85]"/></span></p><p class="pmb2"/><h3 id="pgepubid00093">Part II.</h3><p class="p2">Rosh Chodesh (New Moon) Sivan (approximately May) was followed
six days later by the Shavuot Festival (Pentecost), that beautiful
and pleasant festival, of which the Jews say that one
may eat <em class="gesperrt">everything</em> and <em class="gesperrt">everywhere</em>, while on Passover
one may not eat everything, and on Sukkot not everywhere, i.e., only in
the sukkah. Therefore, Shavuot lasts only two
days....</p><p>For this festival, too, various preparations were naturally
made in our house. We children were taught in the
Cheder the meaning of the festival as a commemoration of the
day on which Moses received the holy tablets of the law on Mount Sinai.
Three days before Pentecost (Shloshet Yemei Hagbalah
this period is called), the mourning of the Sefirah period
ends, and joy revives. One seeks to compensate for the six-week
renunciations. The children
stayed in the Cheder for only half a day and romped freely
outdoors and in the house. And in the houses, there was again
roasting and baking, especially a lot of butter cake!
On these festival days, one mainly eats dairy and
butter dishes. The traditional cheese blintzes with
sour cream, a type of pancake, must not be missing. On Erev Yom Tov,
the eve of the festival, there was again a lot of hurried
work in the house. All rooms were decorated with greenery
and festively lit: We children were dressed festively
and the table was set for dinner; the windows of the candle-lit
rooms stood wide open, and the warm,
fresh spring air streamed in, without even gently moving
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[86]"><a id="Seite_86" title="[86]"/></span>
the flames of the many candles. They burned calmly
and solemnly.</p><p>The men returned from the synagogue, and they
sat down to eat. Already after the first course, a section
from the Tikkun Shavuot laws was read by the men,
and after the second course, another section.
After the meal, my brothers-in-law retired with their Melamed
to their study room to read the Tikkun Shavuot
to the end there until early morning. My elder brother-in-law
submitted to this commandment without grumbling. But the younger one
would probably have preferred another occupation.
But it was no use; the discipline and religious tendency
of our house counted for more than personal wishes and
inclinations. Even then, when the spirit of Lilienthal was already
buzzing in the heads of the young people.</p><p>Early in the morning, they went to the synagogue, where a festive
service was held, the Akdamut (beginnings) were recited, the
Megillah (Ruth) was read, which often lasted until 12 noon.
A cheerful mood prevailed in the house: they drank excellent,
fragrant coffee and ate butter cake and blintzes, and
then went for a walk outdoors.</p><p>Soon summer also came with its splendors,
which we children enjoyed to our heart&#8217;s content. The time from Pentecost
until the seventeenth day of Tammuz (month of July) was for the
Jew of the first half of the 19th century the most enjoyable
and beautiful of the entire summer. But the series of beautiful days
must not be too long for him, otherwise, in his exuberance, he might
forget God, and therefore, I believe,
after a short period of rest, a fast day is always
imposed on him again. And so, the Shiva Asar B&#8217;Tammuz
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[87]"><a id="Seite_87" title="[87]"/></span>
(seventeenth day of Tammuz) is a fast day, followed by the so-called
three weeks, which end with a day of mourning, the ninth day
of the month of Av (Tisha B&#8217;Av). And again, it is forbidden
to pursue amusements, to hold weddings, to bathe in the river,
to wear jewelry, and in the last nine days,
one may also not eat meat; on the ninth day, on
Erev Tisha B&#8217;Av, a memorial service for the destruction of Jerusalem
is held in the synagogue and at home.
On the Friday before Shabbat Chazon (Saturday before Tisha B&#8217;Av),
our mother once appeared, while we were sitting at the breakfast table,
agitated and serious, holding a wooden vessel filled with a black
substance in one hand, and a brush in the other.
We were curious what Mother would do with it.
She climbed onto the sofa and made a square, black spot
on the beautiful red wallpaper with the brush. To our question
what this meant, we received the answer that this spot,
which she called zecher l&#8217;churban, should remind us
that we Jews are in Galut, i.e., subjugated. I
still remember how my father and the young men on
Erev Tisha B&#8217;Av, i.e., on the eve of the ninth day of the
month of Av, took off their shoes and sat on low stools.
The servant placed a low wooden bench
in front of them and set upon it the fasting dinner, which consisted
of hard-boiled eggs, rolled in ashes and then
eaten with hard rings. Moved, with the
expression of sincere sorrow on their faces, they sat there,
as if they themselves had witnessed the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem,
had seen its splendor, its greatness perish with their own eyes.
So present was the past to them, so deeply does the devout Jew still
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[88]"><a id="Seite_88" title="[88]"/></span>
feel the pain for the loss of the old homeland. Then the men went
to the synagogue in stockings without boots. My
mother stayed at home with the older sisters. Several
footstools were brought into a room, and candles were placed on
low tables and chairs. We all sat around
Mother on the footstools, and then they began to read
the &#8220;Destruction of Jerusalem.&#8221; Mother cried,
and we children cried softly with her. Then the Megillah
Eichah &#8212; the Book of Lamentations &#8212; was read, and our tears flowed
freely. The boys, of course, had their own activities.</p><p>Round, green burrs, like small potatoes, covered with spines like pins, which cling to every object, the &#8220;kundesim&#8221; (street boys) on &#8220;erew tischeb&#8217;aw&#8221; used to throw into the hair and onto the stockings of the seriously mourning old men, to annoy them.</p><p>The following day, deep sorrow still prevailed, and a heavy mood still lay upon everyone. In the morning, we were not even allowed to wash; we children sometimes fasted for several hours, and our parents praised our steadfastness. With all the greater appetite, we fell upon the food once half the day had passed. In the house, it also began to become livelier again; the rooms were tidied, and activity resumed in the kitchen. We children took up play and amusement. One of these games on a Tisha B&#8217;Av remained particularly vivid in my memory: My brother had, a few days prior, arranged with a friend of the same age, the present Doctor H. S. Neumark, that on this day he should bring several hundred boys from the town of Chedunim to my brother in the suburb of Zamuchawicz, with whom the two wanted to spend this day appropriately and honorably.
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[89]" id="pgepubid00096"><a id="Seite_89" title="[89]"/></span>
They intended, namely, to stage a battle in memory of that battle which took place approximately 2000 years ago during the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. The boys had to bring their red-painted wooden swords, such as every Jewish boy possessed on that day. Arrows and bows, a club, even a farmer&#8217;s whip also served as weapons. However, personal bravery with the fist was mainly what counted here. My brother and his friend chose an open space next to our house where the battle was to take place. The &#8220;soldiers&#8221; came individually and in crowds. The eager fighters varied in size, age, and status; but such trifles were not heeded in this army! Generals, colonels, and officers were appointed, and the others then formed the troops &#8212; the infantry; my brother and his friend were appointed kings. The generals received paper stars and oak leaves; sashes of blue, red, or white glossy paper fell diagonally over their shoulders. The tricorn hats were made from dark blue sugarloaf paper, which the boys called Krepchen (Kreplach) and adorned with tufts of rooster feathers. The colonel wore cords of red berries around his shoulder as an insignia, and the officers had a large, yellow chamomile attached to the brim of their caps as a cockade. The entire army was divided into two equal sections, and each king took command of his army and lined up the soldiers in rank and file. The kings&#8217; clothing differed conspicuously from that of the other warriors; one king had a large towel, the second a sheet draped across his chest, and both wore countless decorations that had been picked in the fields and meadows: sunflowers,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[90]" id="pgepubid00097"><a id="Seite_90" title="[90]"/></span>
white, yellow, and red blossoms of all sizes. And around the royal heads were wound large wreaths of hemp branches. A cordon was drawn between the two armies, and now the signal for attack was to be given. But who should begin the attack? So, one side shouted: &#8220;Sheli, sheli, sheloch!&#8221; (Send out your people!) To which the other replied: &#8220;My people are sick.&#8221; Now a warrior from this army approached the king of the first army, grasped his hand, and said, raising his index finger: &#8220;The Malach (angel) has sent you three places &#8212; do you see fire? Do you see water? Do you see the sky?&#8221; The king had to look up at the sky at the last question, while the messenger had to flee and cross the cordon if he was not to be captured. But if he succeeded in crossing the cordon in time, his people had the privilege of beginning the fight first. Now they started with sword and arrow and bow; but since these weapons broke at the first clash, the soldiers had to rely on their fists.</p><p>The battle may have already lasted a quarter of an hour, but victory was not yet decided. The howling and shouting, however, grew terribly. Then one of the kings waved a white handkerchief on a white stick and shouted loudly: &#8220;Enough! Stand still! No more hitting!&#8221; But the unruly boys did not listen and continued to work on the skulls and backs of the weaker ones until they had to be admonished with blows to break off the game, which had almost turned serious. Most of them left the battlefield with badges of honor, such as black eyes, bleeding noses, wounded
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[91]" id="pgepubid00097"><a id="Seite_91" title="[91]"/></span>
legs. The kings comforted the brave heroes, and we girls, who watched the battle, brought fresh water, towels, tablecloths from home and fulfilled the office of merciful sisters by washing and drying the bleeding areas of the wounded. After some calm had been restored, the commanders began to prepare the triumphal procession. We were sent back into the house to fetch the necessary props, such as a large brass basin, the brass tray of the samovar, and some copper casseroles. The soldiers had combs covered with paper, which were to be used as wind instruments, and small wooden whistles. The entire army was again gathered and arranged in the square. Although many a soldier could barely stand on his feet, everyone wanted to participate in the solemn act that was now to follow. Now some soldiers were chosen who understood how to handle the devices we had collected as musical instruments. The kings assumed a dignified posture as they were greeted with an overly loud hurrah! and nodded their thanks with their crowned heads. The procession set off. The brass basin, struck by a mighty fist, made a deafening noise. The two casseroles, struck vigorously against each other, boomed. The shrill tones of the whistles sounded like a faint protest against this noise, and the tooting on the paper-covered combs complemented this strange music. The voices of the soldiers also did their utmost: they sang a retreat march with wild power. Amidst these musical sounds, the triumphal procession slowly moved forward. In the bearing of the
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[92]" id="pgepubid00097"><a id="Seite_92" title="[92]"/></span>
kings lay something imposing that rightly made them rulers among these boys. We girls accompanied the procession with clapping hands and were delighted by the whole spectacle. They marched along the garden, past our house. Then the troops disbanded, and each warrior departed with pride. The kings also bid farewell with gracious words, satisfied with the success of the undertaking, which long remained the talk of the entire town. Despite their bloody heads, our parents were very pleased with the custom of warlike games.</p><p>Jewish custom seems to strive to balance every day of mourning or fasting with a subsequent day of joy. Thus, Tisha B&#8217;Av is soon followed by Shabbat Nachamu, i.e., the Sabbath of Consolation: God comforts His people and promises them through the mouth of the prophet the rebuilding of the Temple, which shall rise even more gloriously than before, and the mother city Jerusalem shall rise rejuvenated from its ruins. My parents believed in this promise with unshakeable conviction. They still had their illusions and hopes, which protected them from despair and gave them the strength to bear the sufferings of the present. At that time, suicide among Jews was among the greatest rarities, because they found comfort for all earthly suffering in their faith in God&#8217;s word and in the hereafter. This strong faith also lives in a small song that our pious, wise, kind mother taught us.</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[93]" id="pgepubid00098"><a id="Seite_93" title="[93]"/></span></p><p class="pmb1">It went approximately:</p>
