has received, I proceed with joyful awareness to the
publication of the second volume of my memoirs.</p><p>In accordance with my intention to faithfully and artlessly portray the past,
as it still lives today in <em class="gesperrt">my heart</em> and <em class="gesperrt">my memory</em>,
I wish to continue the thread of my narrative here and let images of vanished
times pass by. I do not want to think of it as becoming a book. I sit down
again in the old comfortable spot and tell: Of my engagement, of the engagement year,
of the wedding, and of all that came afterwards.</p><p>The records in this volume are partly still under the sign
of youthful cheerfulness that enveloped me during my engagement and marriage,
of the marital happiness that still fell into that golden age, in which
Jewish families and marriages were firmly structured and built upon the
foundation of love, loyalty, and friendship.</p><p>But the old times vanished, and with them much that was beautiful and great in
Jewish life. New times came, bringing new customs. Different strings were
struck, and gradually new values formed. The
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[2]" id="pgepubid00008"><a id="Seite_2" title="[2]"/></span>
spirit of the age tore apart the patriarchal-contemplative Jewish family life
and hollowed out a chasm between the old and the young.</p><p>But I thank God that it pleased Him to preserve me until this day,
and that I was granted to hear the hour strike that brought such great
changes in Jewish life, the reawakening of love for Zion, the struggle
for the youth orphaned from their people. At the very first sound, the old
heart recognized the great Jewish melody, which had been silent for so long
and once resonated so deeply and widely&#8230;</p><hr class="tb"/><p>Go forth now, you pages, into the world. You were my comforting
treasure when storm clouds gathered around my homeland. Clouds from which
the gruesome ghosts of the Middle Ages peered. Lonely and forsaken, I moved
to a hospitable land. With my sisters K&#228;the and Helene in Heidelberg, the old
woman, weary from wandering, found a home. Love never ends. I had once nursed
Helene through a severe illness, had borne her sorrow just as my own. Now
she took in the lonely one. The large, square table in her room became a home
to me, on which lay my notes, the meager remnants of a rich life. But the
gentle glow of bygone days lay over them. Memory lifted the stone markers
from the tombs of time and awakened the past to new being. Those were wondrous
hours. Do you remember, Helene? How often we laughed into the displeasure of the
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[3]" id="pgepubid00009"><a id="Seite_3" title="[3]"/></span>
present with blissful thoughts! And oh, the foolish tears, how often they
clouded our gazes&#8230;</p><p>Go forth now, you pages, into the world! You were born of love, love
protected you during my wandering years. Now bring also the love for the old
heritage to my young brothers and sisters!&#8230;</p><p class="pmb3">Whether you have the strength for this blissful blessing &#8212; I do not know.
But I would so dearly hope so. And perhaps I may hope so, without being
considered vain for it, because a man who loved my memories gave me the
courage of hope. <em class="gesperrt">Dr. Gustav Karpeles</em>, who passed away so early,

</div></blockquote><p class="break"/><hr class="chap"/><h2 id="pgepubid00012">Second Period of Enlightenment.</h2><p>In the first volume of my memoirs, I recounted the significant appearance
of Dr. Lilienthal in Lithuania, his captivating effect on the youth, his
cultural mission of the impending Cheder reform, and the first beginnings
of the nascent Enlightenment. The youth, who had previously studied the
Talmud exclusively, were enthusiastic about the new ideas and worked with
sacred earnestness on their own intellectual development. Their ideal was
the unification of general education with Talmudic study. It was Lilienthal
who first brought this desire to expand the narrow confines of old knowledge
and to taste from the &#8220;apple of knowledge&#8221; to a visible breakthrough.</p><p>Alongside Lilienthal, it was Montefiore&#8217;s companion and secretary, Louis Loewe,
who, during his stay in Russia, seized every opportunity to convince Jewish
youth of the necessity of European education. His words found a powerful
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[6]" id="pgepubid00013"><a id="Seite_6" title="[6]"/></span>
echo, for Loewe was at once a man educated in the Western European sense &#8212;
and a good Talmudist: In him, the ideal demands of the youth of that time
were fulfilled. Loewe was uniquely suited to give validity to the new values.
He was, after all, Montefiore&#8217;s companion. And it was inevitable that the
almost idolatrous veneration bestowed upon this generous and brave philanthropist
in all countries where Jews lived would also cast its splendor upon Loewe.
Whoever Montefiore deemed worthy of his constant companionship was allowed
to speak openly. He had nothing to fear, and everyone was certain that his
words stemmed from a pure conviction and could only serve the security and
ennoblement of Judaism.</p><p>It was the year 1846. An imperial ukase had appeared, according to which
all Jews living within fifty versts of the Russian imperial border were to
be expelled. This meant ruin for many thousands of families.</p><p>Here Montefiore&#8217;s work began. It led to victory. The execution of the
draconian provisions was at least initially prevented.</p><p>It was not the first time that Montefiore had taken up the cause of his
co-religionists. Among all the Jews of Europe, the memory of that memorable
journey to Egypt was still vivid, where Montefiore had destroyed the horrific
blood libel, protected the oppressed, and been able to restore the honor of
the Jewish name before the world.</p><p>Almost more than the success of his work in Russia, the Jews were pleased
by the honorable treatment the venerable elderly couple received. In every
major city, Montefiore was received by a high official
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[7]" id="pgepubid00014"><a id="Seite_7" title="[7]"/></span>
who accompanied him to the next station. The gentlemen <em class="gesperrt">had</em> to act this way.
At the behest of the government! Even if they poorly concealed their resentment.</p><p>Even at the imperial court, the couple was received favorably, and the
courtiers treated Sir Montefiore, the English Sheriff, with deference.</p><p>Emperor Nicholas I was very gracious at the last audience and promised
Montefiore to act more leniently towards his co-religionists, but concluded
by remarking: &#8220;If only many Jews in my country were like you, my dear sir!&#8221;
and advised Sir Moses Montefiore to get to know the Jews of Lithuania and
Poland more closely on his return journey.</p><p>On the return journey, Sir Moses Montefiore and his wife were accorded
the greatest honors by the Jews. Every major city prepared a solemn reception
for them. The rabbi and the prominent Jews, joined by respected men, delegates
from other cities, walked a long distance to meet the guests on foot to welcome
them. Unfortunately, they could not communicate directly with the couple, as
Sir Moses Montefiore and Lady Judith spoke only English. Their companion,
Dr. Loewe, served as interpreter. Everywhere, their main attention was directed
to the life of the Jews, which they sought to explore in all its details through
many well-considered questions. Economic and cultural status interested them equally.</p><p>In doing so, neither the Montefiore couple nor Dr. Loewe concealed that they
were unpleasantly affected by the appearance and overall demeanor of the Jews.
Dr. Loewe repeatedly stated
   <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[8]" id="pgepubid00015"><a id="Seite_8" title="[8]"/></span>
that the adoption of Western European education was an absolute necessity for
Russian Jews. &#8220;When the Messiah comes and the Jewish kingdom is restored, then
the Jews must not lag behind other peoples. Jewish youth must educate themselves
to be prepared for civil liberty.&#8221;</p><p>Our city, of course, was not touched by the distinguished couple on this journey.
However, a deputation was sent under the leadership of Rabbi Reb Jankew Me&#239;r Padower
to convey the wishes and thanks of our community to Montefiore. My father would
have been the first to belong to this deputation. Unfortunately, an illness kept
him at home. But in spirit, he followed every step of the distinguished travelers;
for almost every day he received detailed reports. These were festive hours in
our house when these reports arrived. I still see the wonderful glow of bliss
in his eyes when he could discuss the individual events with his table companions,
with us children. Especially vivid in my memory are those memorable eight days
that the distinguished guests spent in Wilna. From Petersburg, a message had
reached Governor-General Mirkowitsch, which already outwardly gave this journey
a very special significance.</p><p>From the fifth post station before Wilna, the Jewish community also received
news via an estafette of the approach of &#8220;the divine envoys,&#8221; as Russian Jews
then called the Montefiore couple.</p><p>A joyful excitement seized the Jewish population of
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[9]" id="pgepubid00016"><a id="Seite_9" title="[9]"/></span>
Wilna. The community prepared comfortable lodging for the distinguished guests
in the wealthy house of the well-known Reb Michel Kotzen and provided abundant,
strictly kosher provisions.</p><p>The most respected citizens of the city, led by the rabbi and city preacher, rode out to meet the guests at the next post station. Thousands of Jews gathered in the Wilna suburb of Schnippeschock to welcome the awaited guests with jubilation there. And when the carriage finally came into sight, a fervent cry rang out from a thousand throats at once: &#8220;B&#8217;ruchim haboim b&#8217;schem Adaunoj!&#8221; (&#8220;Blessed are those who come in the name of God!&#8221;) It sounded so powerfully strong that the air trembled far and wide. The rabbi blessed the arrivals in German and the city preacher in Hebrew. The elders of the community presented them with an occasional poem titled &#8220;Hakarmel.&#8221; The elderly couple was moved to tears by this reception and thanked the community heartily. The people pressed so closely to the carriage that it could only advance very slowly.&#8212;The police were no longer able to maintain order, for they too were swept away by the large crowd. Thus, accompanied by many tens of thousands, the procession arrived in Wilna. The streets were overcrowded; even on the rooftops, many people could be seen. Merchants left their shops. Artisans their workshops. A festive atmosphere prevailed throughout the city.</p><p>That was Wednesday, April 14, 1846!</p><p>The next day, Sir Montefiore, accompanied
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[10]" id="pgepubid00017"><a id="Seite_10" title="[10]"/></span>
by Dr. Loewe, paid an official visit to the Governor-General. Here he was received with the greatest honors. He negotiated with the Governor-General for more than two hours about Jewish affairs and then proceeded to visit the higher military officials.</p><p>In the following hours, the Excellencies returned the visit of the Jewish guests. The Governor-General invited the venerable Montefiore couple to a banquet held in their honor. Montefiore politely declined the invitation, explaining that as a Jew, he was not permitted to partake of their food. The Governor-General asked him to be content with fruits, preserves, and tea and did not relent until Sir Moses Montefiore accommodated him.</p><p>On Friday, early in the morning, the street and the house where the Montefiores resided were besieged by a large crowd, for it was said that Sir Moses Montefiore would visit all charitable institutions without distinction of nationality. It took great effort for the police to maintain peace and order, especially in the streets where the institutions were located. A swarm of poor people of various ages and faiths followed the guest, who distributed large sums of money along the way.</p><p>When Sir Montefiore returned to his residence, a surprise awaited him: The most respected citizens of the city had, in accordance with the custom of the time, sent the finest wines and cakes to the guests for the Sabbath.</p><p>On the eve of the Sabbath, the devout couple wished to go to the synagogue for prayer but could not advance through the crowd and were forced to turn back.</p><p>On Saturday morning, the crowds in the
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[11]" id="pgepubid00018"><a id="Seite_11" title="[11]"/></span>
streets of Wilna were no less dense. Sir Montefiore and Lady Judith therefore had to be led to the synagogue via a side path, but even there they were almost carried on the hands of the crowd. In the synagogue, they found a select audience consisting of Jews and Christians, who had gathered there by special invitation. In the synagogue&#8217;s vestibule, they were greeted by the synagogue board. Ten young, beautiful, white-clad girls strewed flowers before them. One of them stepped forward and welcomed them with a poem that celebrated the journey of the benevolent couple.</p><p>In the prayer room itself, a special prayer was spoken for them.</p><p>On Sunday, the Montefiore couple drove to the banquet at the Governor-General&#8217;s residence. It seemed as if they were not the same people who had been dressed so modestly and simply in the synagogue yesterday. Sir Montefiore sat proudly upright, in his red sheriff&#8217;s uniform richly embroidered with gold, with a large, diamond-studded sword at his side, and a hat adorned with ostrich feathers on his head; next to him was Lady Judith in the most magnificent attire of an English court lady.</p><p>The high Polish nobility was already assembled in the Governor-General&#8217;s reception rooms when the English guests arrived. The host received them in the vestibule. A Polish count, who participated in this banquet, claimed that Lady Judith&#8217;s earrings exceeded the value of all the estates of the magnates present. Another, however, could not suppress the sneering remark as to why such a fuss was being made about a Jewish woman.</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[12]" id="pgepubid00019"><a id="Seite_12" title="[12]"/></span></p><p>In the course of the evening, the Governor-General invited Sir and Lady Montefiore to a performance at the theater, which was given in their honor, to provide an opportunity for the Polish nobility, gathered from all four governorates for the elections, to get to know the worthy elderly couple.</p><p>During the following days, many respected people called on Sir Montefiore to consult with him about the affairs of the Jews in Russia, mainly concerning the upcoming meeting of a Jewish commission in St. Petersburg the following year. Many Jews had come from the province to Wilna to participate in these consultations.</p><p>And until the last hour of their stay in Wilna, this joyful, elevated mood prevailed. The Jews spent that week with the uplifting awareness that these two God-blessed people were among them. With tears and expressions of gratitude, the Jews bid farewell to the elderly couple. Still on their way at the country&#8217;s border, the Montefiores celebrated Passover with a troop of Jewish soldiers.</p><p>The veneration for the elderly couple grew to deification. Thousands of their pictures were produced, and every Jew considered it an honor to acquire such a picture. Even now, after more than fifty years, this picture can be found in good Jewish homes on the large wall above the sofa, and those days have been indelibly etched in Jewish hearts.</p><p>After numerous dangers and great hardships, the

Montefiores arrived in London and were received here in a solemn audience by Queen Victoria. The Queen knighted Sir Montefiore, and as he knelt at her feet, she, performing the usual ceremony, touched his shoulder with the sword and called out to him: &#8220;Arise, Knight of Jerusalem, Moses Montefiore!&#8221; And the hall where the ceremony took place was adorned with numerous flags, all bearing the inscription &#8220;Jerusalem.&#8221;</p><p>I remember, on this occasion, having once read a German translation<a id="FNanchor_1_1"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="6598946804666338120_46307-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_1_1">[1]</a> from an English newspaper, an episode from Queen Victoria&#8217;s girlhood. Many years ago, one beautiful morning in London, a little girl was walking with her governess. They passed a large, rich house surrounded by a garden. Through the gate, a magnificent red rose could be seen, so wonderfully beautiful that it stood out among all other flowers. The child delighted in the flower and finally wanted to pick it. But the governess quickly grasped the child&#8217;s hand to prevent her from carrying out her intention in time. The little girl complied without grumbling with her mentor&#8217;s will and continued the walk without a change of expression. When she came home and entered her room, she found, to her greatest joy, a bouquet of red roses.&#8212;The little obedient girl was none other than the later Queen Victoria of England, and the giver of the bouquet was Moses Montefiore, whom she later knighted.</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[14]" id="pgepubid00021"><a id="Seite_14" title="[14]"/></span></p><p>It was also during the stay in Wilna that Louis Loewe, in a speech richly adorned with arguments and quotations from the Talmud, proved to the numerous crowd in the synagogue that Jewish tradition neither excludes nor condemns the study of sciences and foreign languages.&#8212;</p><p>That Moses Mendelssohn had to become a &#8220;guide for the perplexed&#8221; in those times is easily understood. His German Bible translation and his philosophical works had brought Jewish youth closer to the German spirit and the German language. Until then, they knew the Bible only as a religious book&#8212;now new perspectives emerged before them. People began to view this book of books with secular eyes. The aura of untouchability vanished. Criticism set in.</p><p>It was a revolution of young minds!</p><p>The elders now called this youth &#8220;Berliners&#8221; in the same sense that they were called &#8220;Apikorsim&#8221; (apostates) at the end of the 1830s. Even more than to the living Lilienthal, their wrath was directed at the dead philosopher, whom they called the &#8220;Dessauer&#8221; after his birthplace.</p><p>The German-Russian works, the &#8220;treifene Büchelach&#8221; (unclean little books), were only reluctantly tolerated by the elders: before the Sabbath began, they, like any other remnants of the week&#8217;s work, had to be put away. They remained hidden throughout the entire Sabbath.</p><p>However, with the ever-increasing urge of the youth towards enlightenment, these measures could not last long. Even if the parents still &#8220;bösern&#8221; (got angry), they eventually had to give in.</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[15]" id="pgepubid00022"><a id="Seite_15" title="[15]"/></span></p><p>The new enlightenment ideas of Berolinism could naturally bear the best fruits in the part of Lithuania bordering Courland with its German culture. From this region also emerged a man who played no small role in the history of Jewish enlightenment in Russia&#8212;the first Jewish student in Russia&#8212;L. Mandelstamm. As a seventeen-year-old boy, he was already enthusiastic about Mendelssohn, and in 1844, he followed the example of his role model and translated the Bible. Into Russian. In Russia at that time, there was still a prohibition against writing about sacred things in Russian; and Mandelstamm&#8217;s Bible translation could initially only appear abroad. It was not until 1869 that it also appeared in Russia.</p><p>After Lilienthal had gone to America, Mandelstamm had obtained the position of learned Jew in the Ministry of Public Education. He was tasked with implementing the plan for the reform of the school system, jointly developed by Minister of Education Uwaroff and Lilienthal, and taking over the leadership of the newly established schools. Mandelstamm&#8217;s dictionaries served these new goals, from which entire generations of &#8220;Yeshiva bachurim&#8221; learned the rudiments of the Russian language.</p><p>Knowledge of the works of foreign nations made the youth question and challenge their own religion; and gradually, piety for the age-old tradition, for the laws and customs, faded from Jewish life. The prophecy: The word of God will be set aside
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[16]" id="pgepubid00023"><a id="Seite_16" title="[16]"/></span>
and the holy Hebrew language neglected, had come true.</p><p>My family chronicle, besides my two brothers-in-law, of whom I already spoke in the first volume, also preserves the memory of two young men who were swept away by the new ideas. One was my older brother E. Epstein, the other the husband of my sister K., A. S. Both were gifted, inquisitive, diligent young men; in Brest, where the circle of educated people was already quite large, they belonged to the city&#8217;s elite. They spent only their youth years with the Talmudic folios, but the &#8220;Melamed&#8221; was no longer their only teacher. The study of the Talmud was pursued by them only at specific hours, no longer day and night as in the good old days of my older brothers-in-law. Nevertheless, my brother-in-law, together with my brother, had continued &#8220;learning&#8221; under the guidance of their father and a Melamed for several years even after marriage. It was already the time when Lilienthal&#8217;s movement penetrated broader and deeper strata. Now one was at least allowed to dare to study the &#8220;foreign books&#8221;; and the young people in Brest exploited this possibility in every direction. They organized gatherings where German classics, scientific works, but especially those of the ancient Greeks, were read. Gradually, women were also admitted to these gatherings.</p><p>All parents disapproved of this zeal, for on such occasions, many Jewish customs were violated. For example, gatherings often took place on Saturday, which the parents already saw as a desecration of the Sabbath. And
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[17]" id="pgepubid00024"><a id="Seite_17" title="[17]"/></span>
thus there was again strife and annoyance in family life; and many a tragicomic scene unfolded before my eyes: the eternal struggle of the old and the young, though not always the same.</p><p>When I now look back and reconsider the small annoyances, I must confess that the elders certainly knew what they were doing. The revolution began with externalities. We young people might not have found anything wrong with it. But the elders recognized that even the slightest change in tradition, in outward behavior, must be followed by a revolution of the inner person. I must smile and yet feel serious again when I think of the indignation with which my parents rejected my sister&#8217;s attempts to break the spell of the old costume. It was in the 1840s. That&#8217;s when the peculiar fashion of the crinoline emerged. With us, of course, this monstrosity was still made in a very primitive way. A wide hem was made at the bottom of a calico skirt, and a cane hoop was inserted. A second hoop, also hemmed, followed about a quarter meter higher. After much strenuous effort, my sister Kathy was happily in possession of such a monstrosity. One morning&#8212;we were sitting quietly content in the dining room&#8212;a barrel suddenly appeared in our room, and Kathy was stuck in it. My mother&#8217;s eyes widened: &#8220;What kind of barrel have you put on?&#8221; And without engaging in any further debate, she ordered that the puffy thing disappear immediately. My sister began to cry violently; for she was very sensitive. But she stood still for a while, without
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[18]" id="pgepubid00025"><a id="Seite_18" title="[18]"/></span>
moving. Then her mother called out to her: &#8220;Shall I perhaps help you undress?&#8221;&#8212;That was enough. Crying, Kathy ran to her room, where my mother followed her, seized the fateful skirt, pulled out the cane hoops, folded them up like a snail, and took them to the kitchen. There was a good fire on the stove, and the tripod stood on it. The flames greedily seized the new fashion. In our house, at least, it had the advantage of making the water in the saucepan boil faster.</p><p>My sister Eva fared not much better. Following the fashion of the time, she had made herself a manischka, a kind of jabot, out of white muslin and appeared thus dressed at the dinner table on Friday evening. My parents were utterly outraged. My father said indignantly: &#8220;You look like a goy. How can a Jewish daughter wear a dress that is transparent at the chest!&#8221; My sister dared a few more remarks, saying that she had no ill intention and had only believed that the new garment suited her so well. But there was no further discussion. The jabot had to be removed immediately, or E. was not allowed to come to the table. For that Sabbath, the mood in the house was ruined. But the parents&#8217; word still had the power to suppress these modern attempts of the youth.</p><p>Characteristic of the still unshaken parental authority was also an episode that I would like to recount here. This is certainly not a world-historical event. And yet, a good piece of Jewish cultural history is reflected in it. It was on a Sabbath afternoon. The Sabbath nap,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[19]" id="pgepubid00026"><a id="Seite_19" title="[19]"/></span>
which, as Auneg Shabbos, was among the obligatory pleasures of the Sabbath in the ghetto, was already over. Most Jews were now strolling, enjoying the mood of the evening twilight, on the great highway. The men, of course, strictly separated from the women; and so it was, as it says in the Bible: If you go to the right, I go to the left.&#8212;God knows how many centuries this custom had prevailed in Judaism! Now it happened that my brother-in-law A. Sack wanted to visit his mother with his wife. There, the young man, in whom the storms of the time raged mightily, dared an unheard-of, revolutionary act: he wanted to make this visit together with his wife. Of course, even this Sturm und Drang enthusiast did not dare to go through the busiest streets. So, correctly, they left the house together and had to pass the windows of our dining room, where my father happened to be drinking his afternoon tea. He saw the two sinners, and anger seized him. He hastily knocked on the windowpanes and called out to my sister in a commanding tone: &#8220;You go back immediately. Your husband can go alone. For Jewish women, and especially for my daughters, it is not appropriate to walk close together and still in broad daylight.&#8221;&#8212;My brother-in-law was, of course, very agitated. But he did not dare to offer open resistance. He went his way alone. And my sister, who had returned to the house, followed her husband only when she could assume that he had already reached his destination.</p><p>But this authoritative position of my father, who
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[20]" id="pgepubid00027"><a id="Seite_20" title="[20]"/></span>
could even dare to suppress matters of conscience, was gradually shaken. After severe inner struggles, he finally had to recognize that the fence around the Jewish religion had been breached; and he was disconsolate to see that his dearest treasure, the religion he had guarded and defended through all the storms of life, was now mocked, that the Sabbath and the holidays were stripped of their sanctity and became weekdays. Admonitions and loud protests faded ineffectively against the spirit of the times. What wonder that eventually, for both parties, the old and the young, living together became unbearable in the long run. Neither my brother nor my brother-in-law Sack could stay in the house any longer. It drove them out into the big, wide world. Neither of them had seen a larger city than Brest. But they hoped to get ahead in a foreign land. They did not burden themselves with too much luggage; but they took with them much honest endeavor, a light childlike spirit, strong self-confidence, noble resolutions, and an unshakable faith in humanity and the future. Equipped with these solid travel essentials, they tore themselves away from wife and child, not without pain and struggle, and followed their dark impulse that powerfully drew them away. Sack also did not lose the strength of modern convictions and the knowledge of ancient Jewish culture in his later life. He remained a fighter for enlightenment throughout his life. His tireless endeavor was to embrace the new era with all its cultural content. He stood high above the intellectual level of his surroundings. But his warm-hearted nature and his sparkling spirit
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[21]"><a id="Seite_21" title="[21]"/></span>
excluded any arrogance. An intimate tone prevailed in his house, and his external successes could not change that. His noble character, his philanthropy, his readiness for sacrifice distinguish him from many. The title &#8220;Excellency,&#8221; which Alexander III bestowed upon the deserving director of the St. Petersburg Discount Bank, added no new note to his being. The spirit that prevailed in his house did not vanish when the hardworking man died. He left his wife&#8212;my sister Kathy&#8212;the beautiful legacy of always giving to the poor, the struggling, the disheartened from her wealth. Much nobility emanated from her quiet retreat. Near and far&#8212;artists and scholars know how to speak of it. But I must remain silent about it&#8230;</p><p>Love was a part of the whole family, a love that can also do without education. A. S.&#8217;s older sister was not a child of modernity. The old Jewish house had raised her to a stillness of soul. Just as she stood before her demanding mother full of obedience and self-denial, so intimately tender was she to her stepchildren. Does not folk legend say that the stepmother&#8217;s place in Paradise stands empty? I believe it is now occupied&#8230;</p><p>&#8212;How quickly times change: one could observe this trait with surprised eyes in the brothers of the S. family.</p><p>While the eldest still had to struggle for the recognition of the Enlightenment, for his younger brothers, the study of the Bible and the Talmud was merely an addition to the new program. They mostly devoted all their effort
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[22]" id="pgepubid00028"><a id="Seite_22" title="[22]"/></span>
and diligence to the study of foreign languages<a id="FNanchor_2_2"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="6598946804666338120_46307-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_2_2">[2]</a>.</p><hr class="tb"/><p>Similar yet different was the nature of my brother Ephraim&#8217;s life. I do not wish to close this chapter without speaking, with wistful emotion, of his destinies, his wanderings, and his &#8212; transformations.</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[23]" id="pgepubid00029"><a id="Seite_23" title="[23]"/></span></p><p>My brother Ephraim resembled my mother more than our father. The father was stern and strict. The mother was gentle and dreamy. He was devoted to her with his whole soul. He was the only son in the house. The bearer of the name, the &#8220;Kaddish&#8221;. No wonder that father and mother and we sisters all spoiled him! My father&#8217;s serious disposition introduced him early to the sacred halls of the Bible. He was not yet ten years old when he already knew a large part of the five books by heart. In his eleventh year, he was at home in the intellectual sphere of the prophets. In their power, in their melancholy, in the intimacy and grandeur of their religious world, he found his spiritual nourishment. And it was his greatest delight when he could read the prophetic portion in the synagogue. In his wonderful voice lay all the romance of a dreamy, blissful boy. The listeners devoutly listened. But my father was full of pride, and the certainty of an heir to his national Jewish conviction was within him. When Ephraim turned twelve, the world of the Talmud opened up to him. Alongside this, however, he learned the Russian and German languages and sang the songs of foreign peoples with delightful joy. Yet he was by no means a homebody. The seriousness of his studies had never suppressed his cheerful childlike nature. Among his youthful comrades, he was one of the most cheerful. And his play was full of tumbling ideas. His good humor could cheer up the gloomiest. How often we sisters had to laugh about him, with him! Pouting angrily yet amused, we called him the &#8220;Head-turner&#8221;. Truly, he could turn anyone&#8217;s head.</p><p>Thus he grew up, becoming freer in his understanding of Judaism. For no young mind could escape the spirit of the Lilienthal era. But the strength of his deep religiosity was unshakable. Then an event entered his life that was to become his destiny. His parents urged him to marry. Their choice fell upon our cousin. He did not love her, nor did she him. But the will of the parents prevailed. The grandfather did not want the fortune to be scattered
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[24]" id="pgepubid00030"><a id="Seite_24" title="[24]"/></span>
. So Ephraim had to marry the girl, whether he wanted to or not. After the birth of his first child, Ephraim went to North America. He had his wife&#8217;s consent. But it was still the unhappy life that drove him from home. And there was no lack of discord with his parents either: the Enlightenment carved a deep chasm between father and son.</p><p class="pmb3">Emigration to America! It was a journey from the land of bondage. There, in freedom, he wanted to begin a new life, to create and study, to test his full strength and spiritual richness against new goals. The crossing was terrible. Nine weeks on a sailing ship! Almost four weeks in icy cold, exposed to the storms of the Channel. Lonely and abandoned, he was now in a foreign land: and his funds had dwindled. He could not live from the work of his hands. He had learned nothing to assert himself. He tried his hand at trade. He tried factory work. But that was no life for a man of intellectual stimulation. Then a star of hope shone in his night: Lilienthal. The same Lilienthal who had aroused cultural longing in the youth of Brest, now lived in New York. Ephraim went to him. He told him the story of his suffering. But it was a cold reception that completely confused the sensitive mind of the young man full of life&#8217;s storms. What a harsh word can do! A kind word: how differently my brother&#8217;s life would have turned out in the future! He started again with manual labor. Agriculture had been presented to the young fighters as the highest ideal
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[25]" id="pgepubid00031"><a id="Seite_25" title="[25]"/></span>
. He went to a farm. To a Christian who kindly took him in. Soon he was able to acquire his own small farm, which was about twelve miles from New York. Here, in this new circle, he fully adapted to the new way of life. He went to church. He listened to the sermon. It was particularly the speech of a clergyman, whose words of sin, punishment, repentance, and forgiveness powerfully gripped him. He kept himself completely aloof from Jewish society. The sermon was actually his only spiritual recreation. There he found a friend. A childhood companion from his hometown of Brest, who, after many wanderings in America, had ended up as a wind instrument maker. This friend had left Judaism, and he persuaded Ephraim to be baptized. That was a momentous step. He attracted attention. His rich knowledge of biblical and talmudic literature was to be put to use. He gave up his farm, became a theologian, and soon traveled from town to town as a preacher. He was able to complete his studies with great success. While still studying at the seminary, he called his wife and child from Russia to him. They came. But despite all outward peacefulness, there was no real communion. In the lives of sensitive people, there is so much that is hidden, that can never be set straight, and so many gaps that never fill. His friends urged my brother to dedicate his life to Jewish mission work. He agreed to do so. But only on the condition that he be allowed to study medicine first. His wish was granted; and after another three years, he was able to complete his
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[26]"><a id="Seite_26" title="[26]"/></span>
medical studies. He was called to the Balkan Peninsula, where he lived for several years in various cities. His missionary work was unsuccessful. And when funds for a mission school were denied to him, he soon separated from this activity and henceforth practiced only medicine. Among Jews, Turks, Bulgarians, and Greeks, he found a large clientele. At the beginning of the 1860s, my brother received news that, after the death of his grandfather, several thousand rubles had fallen to him and his wife. His family life in Turkey had not become happier than in America; and so the inheritance came just in time to fulfill his unconquerable longing. He wanted to see his siblings again. And his mother. The siblings might forgive. The mother knew no forgiveness. They met in a German city. The reunion was agonizing, heartbreaking. The old mother fell at her son&#8217;s feet and swore that she would not get up until her son returned to the faith of his fathers and never again went to America during her lifetime. My brother made the promise. He remained in Germany and became a Jew who faithfully observed the statutes of his religion. Son&#8217;s love triumphed. He stayed for a short time with his mother and father in Germany. They felt happy. They had reached their life&#8217;s goal. Their son belonged to them again. It was as if they had been blessed with another child in their old age. But before the parents returned home, they still had a difficult task. My brother&#8217;s marriage, long broken internally, was dissolved according to
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[27]"><a id="Seite_27" title="[27]"/></span>
Jewish law. The wife kept one child; the other had died in the meantime. My brother went to Vienna to devote himself to further medical studies. Meanwhile, our old mother passed away. Ephraim was now free. He could again think of returning to America. In the meantime, the war between Austria and Italy had broken out. My brother participated in the naval battle of Lissa under Admiral Tegetoff as a corvette doctor. He then sang about this battle in an English epic. Tegetoff gratefully accepted the dedication, and the Emperor rewarded the poetic doctor with an honorarium of 600 Florins. Now my brother returned to America, where he worked as a professor of languages at a number of universities. Soon, however, he resumed his practice, went to Chicago, where he is still co-editor of the American Journal of Clinical Medicine today. He had married a second time in Cincinnati. Seven children were born from this marriage. Despite his 81 years, he is vigorously active, and his fellow citizens hold him in high esteem.</p><p class="break"/><hr class="chap"/><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[28]" id="pgepubid00032"><a id="Seite_28" title="[28]"/></span></p><h2 id="pgepubid00033"> <a id="Meine_Verlobung">My Engagement.</a></h2><blockquote><div>

I opened it, thoughtfully leafed through the yellowed papers, and before I knew it, the entire happy past enveloped me. I forgot my surroundings and read &#8212; I felt the crust of ice that life had formed around my heart gradually melt, youth rose within me and with it all the feelings I once experienced, so fresh, so vivid, as if it had been yesterday.

F., I had even more to attend to in our household than before. Besides the household, however, I learned a great deal, becoming ever more diligent, as if an inner voice told me that I would not be able to work in my father&#8217;s house much longer. I attended a private school with a few other girls, where we were taught Russian and German. Our teacher was an older gentleman named David Podrewski. His crooked mouth often made it difficult for him to pronounce certain harsh Russian words, which is why we could not always understand him. Of the two languages, only German was truly familiar to him; his knowledge of the Russian language was very deficient. Two rubles monthly for three hours of daily instruction &#8212; that was his fee.</p><p>I took great pleasure in books. But since no children&#8217;s library was available to us in those days, I read everything that came into my hands: fairy tales, all sorts of stories in Yiddish-German, Gdules Josef,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[30]" id="pgepubid00035"><a id="Seite_30" title="[30]"/></span>
&#8220;Zenture, Wenture&#8221; (adventure stories), Bobe-meisses, (Bowe-Korelewitsch). Most of all, however, my mind was captivated by the rich, fantastic, oriental tales of &#8220;One Thousand and One Nights&#8221;.</p><p>This reading satisfied me only until my eleventh year; later, Robinson Crusoe became my favorite book, and still later, Zschokke and Schiller, whose first volume, with its poetic content, was sung and memorized by us girls. We shared this interest in Schiller with the educated Jewish youth of those days, who were enthusiastic about this great poet and diligently studied his works. Into the oppressive, dull atmosphere of the ghetto, Schiller&#8217;s poetry penetrated like a breath of spring, and the Jews admired all the splendor and beauty that suddenly appeared before them. Among the Jews, Schiller played an important role, both in their lives and in their literature. When Jewish youth began to read foreign works, they first turned to Schiller; they were inspired by him and developed their knowledge of the German language. Men memorized Schiller, just like us young girls. And soon, knowledge of Schiller&#8217;s works became part of the curriculum for an educated Jew; he learned the Talmud and Schiller, the latter using the same method as the Talmud. Every important sentence was discussed individually, and thought about aloud; questions and possible answers followed one another, and it was debated until a satisfactory solution was found and the supposedly deep meaning that was <em class="gesperrt">behind</em> the words. During that time, numerous
     <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[31]" id="pgepubid00036"><a id="Seite_31" title="[31]"/></span>
translations into Hebrew also appeared, written by the best Jewish poets, all of whom tried their hand at Schiller. The cause of this popularity is to be found in the essence of Schiller&#8217;s poetry, its intellectual character, in its seriousness, its pathos, in its idealism, which views all events from a moral perspective.</p><p>It was at school that I first got my hands on a Russian book, a collection of poems by Griboyedov and Zhukovsky. Many a poem in this collection moved me to tears, and a prose narrative, the life descriptions of a hermit who called himself Vadim and his friend Gostomisl &#8212; these two heroes of ancient Russian past, I had to read again and again, and even today, after 65 years, I know the whole story by heart.</p><p>Months passed since my sister&#8217;s wedding, and one day was like the next; I had no idea how near the day was that would put an end to this even and quiet life.

My mother took me by the arm, told me to stand up, turned me around, and subjected my entire figure to an examination; she smiled lovingly and exchanged knowing glances with my father.</p><p>Although I did not understand my parents&#8217; behavior, I instinctively blushed under their gaze; however, I did not dare to ask them a question.

cheek, and left, conversing with my father. I remained in my place, thoughtful and motionless. What could my parents&#8217; strange behavior mean? The question tormented me for a long time until I thought I found an explanation: On that summer morning in 1848, I was wearing a blue summer dress that my mother liked very much, and she probably wanted to show me in this dress to my father, who always wished to see us children nicely dressed.</p><p>So innocent were the thoughts and feelings of children at that time, when their parents were already harboring marriage plans for them.</p><p>Since that morning, however, the behavior of all household members towards me changed; I was given much more attention than usual, and I noticed that father, mother, and siblings often looked at me with particular interest. Only in the next few days did I learn the reason for this strange attention. My father had answered affirmatively a letter containing a marriage proposal for me. This letter came from the Rebbe (Talmud teacher), who was looking for a bride for his student.</p><p>Entirely according to patriarchal custom, my husband&#8217;s parents had sent the Rebbe of the adult student out into the world to find a bride. The Shadchanim (matchmakers) informed him where pretty girls from good families could be found.</p><p>The Rebbe, who had written to my father, had already been to several cities but had not yet found the desired one. And now he came to Brest to
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[33]" id="pgepubid00038"><a id="Seite_33" title="[33]"/></span>
obtain a bride for his student in our house.</p><p>The parents of the young man in question were wealthy people and sought wives from noble Jewish families for their sons. The noble, wealthy Jew of that time always strove to find a Bas Tovim, i.e., the daughter of a Talmudically educated person, for his son. On the other hand, he spared no effort or money to give his daughter an equally educated Talmudist as a husband. Talmudic scholarship and its cultivation was, for the Jew of that time, the main content of his life, the sole source of his wisdom and spiritual development.</p><p>Everything in the house became agitated. Everyone knew who the stranger was and what intentions brought him to us. I alone dared not think about it. My older sisters gathered with their husbands for a family council, and the elder brother-in-law took over the mediation between my parents and the representative of my future in-laws. The family council decided to invite the Rebbe for tea. No one, however, thought it right to inform me of this. At the dinner table, this event was spoken of only in hints. The parents were in a joyful mood. &#8212; But my agitation increased with every minute, and my poor heart, in which premonitions rose clearer and clearer, threatened to burst. The entire time at the table I had to compose myself so as not to burst into tears.</p><p>After dinner, I went out. I had to be alone with my thoughts, with all the new, unknown feelings,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[34]" id="pgepubid00039"><a id="Seite_34" title="[34]"/></span>
that had awakened so suddenly within me, giving my young life a completely new meaning. I did not follow my sisters&#8217; advice, who urged me to wear a beautiful dress, but kept on my blue dress with the black silk apron. &#8220;He&#8221; should see me as I am every day, as my family and I myself saw me.</p><p>When I returned home towards evening, I was told that the foreign gentleman had already arrived but was prevented from staying for dinner. However, since he had to see me, my father asked me to bring the burning candles into his study, where the two gentlemen were. I obeyed, took both candelabras with the burning candles, and went into my father&#8217;s study. It was a short walk. But this time seemed like an eternity to me. How many thoughts raced through my head in those few minutes. A storm rose in my chest; my heart seemed to stand still. Outwardly, however, I looked completely calm. A soft knock, and I stood on the threshold of that room, as if on the threshold of a new life.</p><p>As the light blinded me, I raised the candles high, above my head, and stood there, in their full light &#8212; and waited. Then from the farthest corner of the room, my father&#8217;s voice resounded, as he conversed with the foreign gentleman on the sofa. I followed his voice, still holding the candles above my head.</p><p>The man rose from the sofa, and my father introduced me to him: &#8220;This is my Pessele.&#8221; I felt
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[35]" id="pgepubid00040"><a id="Seite_35" title="[35]"/></span>
a pair of large, intelligent, black eyes fixed inquiringly on me. It was a scrutinizing, penetrating gaze that immediately told me that the Rebbe&#8217;s destination had been reached here. I blushed under this gaze and was unable to utter a single word. My shyness and confusion were so great that I still held the candles above my head until my father drew my attention to it. I placed the candelabras on the table, looked at the gentleman once more, and silently left the room.</p><p>In the dining room, all my relatives were already waiting for me, immediately assailing me with questions. But I earnestly begged them not to speak about the whole matter at all, which caused me to be incessantly laughed at and teased.</p><p>After an hour, Mr. Brim (that was the Rebbe&#8217;s name) bid farewell to my parents and set off that same evening on his return journey to Konotop (800 Russian versts from our town).</p><p>Soon a letter arrived from Konotop, in which the Rebbe informed my father that he had arranged everything according to his wishes, and that Mr. Wengeroff, with his son and himself, would embark on the long journey in the next few days. We were to meet my future groom in a small town called Kartuskaya Beryoza, fifteen miles away from us, and if we liked each other, celebrate the engagement there immediately.</p><p>My girlish heart barely knew the feelings of love yet; suddenly, it was torn from its slumber. Unforeseen images rushed upon me. In the twilight hour
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[36]" id="pgepubid00041"><a id="Seite_36" title="[36]"/></span>
I now often sat and dreamed of love, of the man who was to become my life&#8217;s companion, and our shared destiny&#8230;&#8230; They were quiet, bright dreams that I dreamed every evening in the twilight hour back then; for my deeply believing soul hoped for all good things for the future. &#8212;</p><p>I sought solitude. I wanted to be alone with my dreams, which I grew to love so much. But I was never alone, for the image of my future husband never left me, and in my imagination, he took on the most varied forms: One time he was blond, with light eyes, another time dark, and a pair of dark, deep, beautiful eyes looked at me full of love. I blushed before myself: my dreams shamed me so, but I loved them so much, loved them above all else. &#8212;</p><p>Sometimes, when I sat in the garden, lost in my dreams, the girls who were doing the garden work would strike up teasing, flattering little songs for me. Most of all, I loved to hear the song of the beautiful girl who came from distinguished rabbis:</p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div><hr class="tb"/><p>The preparations for my engagement were magnificent. I received very beautiful things. It was decided that the recently married sister with her husband, the elder brother, sister Käthy, and the elder brother-in-law Samuel Feigisch should accompany us.</p><p>The Wengeroffs&#8217; journey to the agreed-upon town lasted fourteen days. Finally, their destination was reached, and they informed us of it by an estafette. We departed and arrived at Kartuskaja Berjosa the very next day, at night.</p><p>It was June 15, 1849 &#8212; a date that has deeply imprinted itself on my heart and that I will never forget.</p><p>At the inn where we took lodging, we were told that the Wengeroffs were staying at the inn opposite us; only a small, narrow alley lay between, and the innkeeper assured us that we could look into their windows from ours, especially from the small room that had been prepared for me. I went to my room, arranged my things, and did not fail, though I was very tired, to lift the muslin curtain to cast a stealthy glance into the neighbor&#8217;s window. A secret voice in my heart softly flattered me that the same maneuver must have often occurred from the other side
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[38]" id="pgepubid00042"><a id="Seite_38" title="[38]"/></span>
. Finally, fatigue overcame me, and I fell fast asleep.</p><p>The next morning, loud voices from my parents&#8217; adjoining room woke me from my sleep, which I involuntarily had to hear. The heated debate between my mother and my brother-in-law touched upon &#8212; very thoroughly, according to the custom of the time &#8212; the material side of the upcoming engagement: dowry, gifts, jewels, etc. They disagreed on these questions and talked back and forth. Only my father put an end to the dispute by assuring them: &#8220;If only the young man&#8217;s knowledge of the Talmud is good, the rest will take care of itself.&#8221;</p><p>And now my father prepared for the act that was actually to decide my fate &#8212; namely, to test the future son-in-law&#8217;s knowledge of the Talmud; for the degree of Talmudic knowledge was, in those times, almost decisive for which family a young man was worthy to marry into. No wonder. For it was exclusively the Talmud that was accessible as spiritual nourishment to the Jewish youth of that time and could have a refining and ennobling effect on them. For most, there was no path to other sources of knowledge.</p><p>Now my father went to the Wengeroffs. He returned to us in a joyful mood; he indulged in the most flattering remarks about the young man and exuberantly praised his Talmudic knowledge.</p><p>He was also completely taken with old Wengeroff. In short, he did not want to delay the matter and was determined to celebrate the engagement that very day. Both of us, my future husband and I
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[39]" id="pgepubid00043"><a id="Seite_39" title="[39]"/></span>
were to become acquainted before the official engagement ceremony. For this purpose, father and son were invited to our house.</p><p>When I entered the dining room, my relatives were already gathered there. After a few minutes, a handsome, elderly gentleman entered without any announcement, accompanied by a youthful but imposing figure. Everyone rose and went towards the two. I could barely stand upright from excitement. We sat down. I tried to compose myself to strike up a conversation with my future husband&#8217;s father, according to the custom of the time. Soon there was so much to talk about that the conversation became general.</p><p>My family spoke what was called Russian-German, while the two Wengeroffs used a Lithuanian-Jewish jargon, and that only imperfectly. It turned out that the Russian language was much more familiar to them, and so we continued to converse mostly in Russian. Soon the small circle was so familiar with each other, as if they had known each other for ages.</p><p>Gradually, the young people moved into the adjoining room, my future husband also joined them, and finally, my sister Kathy asked me to follow the others. Here, etiquette was set aside. We sat informally next to each other, and naturally, I came to be near my groom. We had barely sat next to each other for a while when the room became empty &#8212; everyone left to leave us both undisturbed. This behavior annoyed me so much that I was unable to utter a single word,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[40]" id="pgepubid00044"><a id="Seite_40" title="[40]"/></span>
and I remained silent, embarrassed. But then my future husband began to speak. Trembling with emotion, he spoke to me of his feelings, of love, loyalty, of imperishable bliss. His eyes told me much more than his words.</p><p>But two young people before their engagement were not allowed to remain alone together for too long. There was a soft knock at the door, and sister Kathy came to fetch us.</p><p>In the large room, everyone waited for us to celebrate the engagement. According to the ancient custom, which still applies among pious Jews today, a document, the &#8220;Tnoïm,&#8221; was drawn up, precisely recording how much property my groom and I would receive, when the wedding should take place, etc. After this document had been read aloud, a vessel was broken. This custom was a symbol of the fragility of earthly existence. And a warning.</p><p>Everyone congratulated each other. Wine and sweets were served. A cheerful, lively bustle began. We all had lunch together, and my groom did not leave my side. In the afternoon, we were all invited for tea at the Wengeroffs&#8217;, where time passed in pleasant conversation around the bubbling samovar and a richly set tea table. My father expressed the wish that his future son-in-law should learn the German language, because it was indispensable in our country for social reasons, and both the father-in-law and his son acknowledged the legitimacy of this wish.</p><p>At the Wengeroffs&#8217;, the same maneuver occurred as with
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[41]" id="pgepubid00045"><a id="Seite_41" title="[41]"/></span>
us: the young people found the parents&#8217; factual conversation too restrictive, and one after another disappeared into my groom&#8217;s nearby room. The question arose whether I was allowed to join the others. My mother considered it a breach of custom. But my elder brother-in-law interceded for me, and she finally allowed it. When I appeared in my groom&#8217;s room on my brother-in-law&#8217;s arm, he became quite giddy with joy. With every hour, our affection, sympathy, and attachment grew, and we drank from the cup of bliss in full draughts. &#8212;</p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, if it would forever remain green,<br/>
</span>
<span class="i0">the beautiful time of young love!<br/>
</span>
</div></div><p>It was getting late &#8212; in the parents&#8217; opinion. My mother entered the room and whispered to me that it was inappropriate to stay with the groom for so long, and I felt a slight disapproval of my behavior in her tone. We went home. In the dark hallway leading to our apartment, I heard the footsteps of young Wengeroff behind us, accompanying us. But I did not dare to look back, so as not to further increase my mother&#8217;s dissatisfaction.</p><p>That is how strictly we were raised back then. That is how our mothers protected us, not out of mistrust, but solely because they regarded it as their task, sanctified by tradition, to watch over their daughters. It was tenderness and care that sought to aid our naivety, by no means fear of the consequences of feminine cunning. The mothers of today, if they read these
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[42]" id="pgepubid00046"><a id="Seite_42" title="[42]"/></span>
lines, might perhaps long for those good old times.</p><p>The following day I awoke happy, radiant with joy; and without any prompting, I put on my best clothes. Soon, however, my joy was clouded when I learned that we were to begin our return journey that very afternoon. But when our parents looked at my groom&#8217;s and my saddened faces, they felt pity, and the departure was postponed until the next morning.</p><p>We cheered with joy. The elders did not disturb us young ones. We took a carriage ride, were almost boisterously merry along the way, experienced adventures with peasants, and returned to our family in the happiest of moods. We spent the rest of the day drinking tea, snacking, with all sorts of antics; we sang our Polish-Jewish songs in chorus, my groom sang his Russian ones, and so time passed until dinner. After dinner, fatigue overcame us, and we parted early from each other.</p><p>But I found no rest that night; I could not fall asleep. &#8212; Daring thoughts and images kept me awake. My heart reveled in bliss.</p><p>The reader will have noticed the extent of the upheaval that had taken place in Jewish family life in the short time since my sister&#8217;s engagement. My sister Eva saw her groom for the first time in her life immediately before the wedding ceremony. She resisted, refusing to put on the wedding dress before she had spoken to him.
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[43]" id="pgepubid00047"><a id="Seite_43" title="[43]"/></span>
Yet a stern look from her mother was enough to tame the rebellious one. When the two finally stood opposite each other as bride and groom, not even a handshake was allowed between them. But I was allowed to come to his room with my siblings; to go on an excursion with him and exclusively in young company.</p><p>Here we see the dawn of a time when the seclusion of Jewish family life begins to loosen. Imperceptibly, foreign, non-Jewish elements penetrate the indigenous Jewish family customs. Another generation, and the old Jewish custom will seem like a long-faded fairy tale.</p><p>The following day I got up very early, and in a dull, gloomy mood, I prepared for departure. The carriage was already at the door, my parents and siblings were ready to travel; the Wengeroffs came to have breakfast with us. When I looked at my fiancé, I noticed traces of tears on his face. &#8212;</p><p>We still had so much to say to each other and both remained silent.</p><p>At the breakfast table, only the elders spoke. The young people remained silent, anxious. The hour of separation came. Everyone rose from the table. At that moment, I could no longer control myself, and when my groom embraced me goodbye &#8212; an unheard-of act for those times &#8212; I burst into violent weeping. The parents were moved and allowed us to walk ahead alone for a good distance. The rest of the company and
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[44]" id="pgepubid00048"><a id="Seite_44" title="[44]"/></span>
the Wengeroff carriage followed. An incident prolonged our time together: I suddenly discovered that my newly gifted splendid watch and chain were missing. This gave occasion to go back part of the way to look for what was lost. We found both again, and everyone claimed it was of good omen for us.</p><p>We reached our family and got into the carriages. One last glance, and the carriages quickly moved away from each other. I pressed myself into a corner of the carriage and sank into gloomy thoughts. It felt as if the dearest, most beautiful, and most sublime part of my life was fading from me. I suffered unspeakably in my pain. My sister tried to calm me. Then I suddenly realized that I had betrayed the innermost part of my heart. I was ashamed of my weakness. That helped. I became calmer and calmer and comforted myself with the hope of a reunion.</p><p>My parents, however, sought to reassure me with the promise that my groom and I would meet again before the wedding. Thus, the pain of separation subsided. Fresh and cheerful, we arrived home.</p><p>Soon relatives, friends, and acquaintances visited us and congratulated us warmly. I showed the precious gifts: a large string of pearls, long diamond earrings, a chain with a watch. At the same time, I had to assure them that, as the expression of the time went, &#8220;thank God, I feel very happy.&#8221;</p><p>In the choice of gifts, which were called Kalle- and Chossen-Matones (bride&#8217;s and groom&#8217;s gifts), one usually followed not only personal taste,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[45]" id="pgepubid00049"><a id="Seite_45" title="[45]"/></span>
but mainly adhered to the generally prevailing custom. Certain gifts were considered indispensable, and every Kalle and every Chossen, even the poorest, had to receive them. Even the poorest Chossen received, for the wedding, above all a Tallis (prayer shawl) and a &#8220;Kittel&#8221; (shroud), which the younger man wore exclusively on Yom Kippur, and the older man, who already had adult children, also wore on Seder evenings. If the Kalle was poor, &#8220;collections&#8221; were made for her, first and foremost for a Tallis for her Chossen. The gifts also included a small cap made of silver threads; for the engagement, a watch without a chain (gentlemen at that time wore their watches on black silk cords, which the bride usually made herself). I still remember the little chain my sister had made for her fiancé &#8212; it was very artfully braided, decorated with small colorful glass beads.</p><p>If the Kalle was a rich girl, the Chossen also received for the wedding a Shtreimel &#8212; a hat made of the most precious fur &#8212; and a &#8220;silver Puschkele&#8221; (snuffbox).</p><p>Above all, the Kalle was given a prayer book for the wedding, called &#8220;Korban Mincha.&#8221;</p><p>Among the gifts for the so-called Balbatim daughters (daughters of wealthy people), who often had no more than 100 rubles in dowry, there was always a &#8220;Kanek&#8221; &#8212; a necklace of black velvet, set with rows of small, genuine pearls; the pearls had to be <em class="gesperrt">genuine</em>; the wealth of the Mechutonim (in-laws) could only determine their size. Attached to the Kanek as pendants were some
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[46]" id="pgepubid00050"><a id="Seite_46" title="[46]"/></span>
ducats, or for the wealthiest, some larger gold coins, worth 15 rubles, or even larger coins, on which three kings&#8217; heads were visible in profile and which had a value of 30 rubles. These coins were called <em class="gesperrt">Schaustück</em> (display piece). Furthermore, the bride received two &#8220;Schleierlach&#8221; (veils) made of fine, white nettle fabric, which were worn on the head. For wealthy matches, the bride was given diamonds, mainly earrings, strings of pearls, and a gold chain, but without the watch &#8212; which only came into use as a bridal gift in the 1840s. This chain was often worn over street clothes when going out, as I described in the first volume. It was fastened to the chest with a pin in fantastic shapes.</p><p>These gifts were not exchanged between the engaged couple, but rather they were presented by the future in-laws to the bride and groom on the wedding day. Around 12 o&#8217;clock noon, the &#8220;Badchan,&#8221; accompanied by music, brought the gifts to the bride&#8217;s house.</p><p class="pmb3">In the patriarchal life of those times, custom had regulated all of life. Today&#8217;s generation, in its exaggerated sentimentality, may find this very meticulous arrangement strange, perhaps even embarrassing. And yet one can say that the precise agreements had only one purpose: to avoid from the outset all ill feelings, quarrels, and hostilities between the two families.</p><p class="break"/><hr class="chap"/><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[47]" id="pgepubid00051"><a id="Seite_47" title="[47]"/></span></p><div class="pmb3"/><h2 id="pgepubid00052"> <a id="Das_Brautjahr">The Bridal Year.</a></h2><p>I returned to my everyday life. It was embarrassing for me to be treated as a Kalle (bride). I asked my relatives not to speak of my groom. I tolerated no favoritism in the house and fulfilled all my duties as before. I now mainly took care of the household; for my older sister had no interest in it, and our dear mother spent the day praying, singing psalms, and reading holy books, such as &#8220;Menoras Hamaor&#8221; and &#8220;Nachlas Tzvi.&#8221;</p><p>Meanwhile, I diligently continued my studies with Mr. Podrowski; for I firmly held to the resolution to thoroughly work through both grammars, the Russian one by Vostokov and the German one by Heyse, before my wedding. Every task was now easy for me; so much freshness, joy, and zest for life was within me, such a feeling of happiness overwhelmed me; it also spread to others, and joy reigned in our house.</p><p class="pmb1">Only more than three weeks after my engagement did my father return from the city, radiant with joy, and handed me a sealed letter addressed to me with the words: &#8220;Here is a letter for you, certainly from your groom.&#8221; For the first time in my life, I received a letter; with trembling hands, I opened it and read the following:</p><blockquote><div>
<p>&#8220;Much beloved and dear Peschinke, may you live for me, be healthy, my only soul!</p>
<p>Now we are in Slutsk. You are surely already

    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[48]" id="pgepubid00053"><a id="Seite_48" title="[48]"/></span>

at home, I am already 275 versts far from you. Only yesterday I was living with you (next to you), and I heard your sweet, dear speech! Oh, how happy I was! But now I see only that after two hours, which Father wants to spend here, I will have to drive further and further, with every minute, every second moving further away (distancing myself) from you, my dear Pessunju. My dear, only soul Pessunju, you can imagine (yourself) how it was for me when I sat myself in the carriage to make the journey, and two seconds later I already saw you no more! How it was for me afterwards, I could describe to you for pages, but I fear perhaps (maybe) you will be uneasy; only you alone can understand, my angel, that alone will be my comfort, as I will read your handwriting, dear to me, in which I will read your feelings for me. Oh, that will make me reborn! After that, it will remain one thing, how to spend quicker (faster) the time that separates us from each other. For that, I will keep your command, that will be my pleasure and that I will still receive your sweet letters with your words!</p>
<p>In the middle of the journey, we had another stop (stay). Two stations (stops) departing from Berese. We stood there for six hours, from 10 o&#8217;clock in the morning until 4 o&#8217;clock in the evening. This time was much more cheerful for me, I pondered (considered) how much further I would have been from you than if I had traveled that time. &#8212;</p>
<p>I hope that you will give me the pleasure to

<span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[49]" id="pgepubid00054"><a id="Seite_49" title="[49]"/></span>

gladden me with your letters, therefore I ask no more.</p>
<p>Be healthy and cheerful for me, may God grant that we see each other quicker (faster), my dear Pessunju!</p>
<p class="ir1">Chonon Wengeroff.</p>
<p class="p1">P. S. Dearest! you will be able to write my name on the envelope, I beg you very much. Forgive me for what I have written so badly, because I have written with a lead pencil. &#8212;</p>
<p>I beg you, ask everyone for my sake to forgive me for what I write; we are hurrying (rushing) very much. Remain healthy for me once more, as your</p>

</div>
<p>I am writing the address with your name, because Father has ordered me to do so.&#8221; &#8212;</p>
</div></blockquote><p class="p1">My confusion was boundless as I read these tender outpourings of the heart. My parents asked me about the content of the letter; however, I could not tell them. Only with tears in my eyes did I ask them for permission to fulfill my fianc&#8217;s request to write to him often. The parents consented, which, given the orthodox worldview of that time, was very astonishing and characteristic of the two people. So great was their joy that their Pessele had received a letter addressed to her name, that they became more lenient and truly gave their
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[50]" id="pgepubid00055"><a id="Seite_50" title="[50]"/></span>
permission for this correspondence; and so our correspondence began.</p><p>I have always kept my fianc&#8217;s letters as my most precious possessions, and even today, after fifty-nine years, they are all in my possession. Sometimes I leaf through the yellowed papers, conjure up the beautiful time, and still bask in the rays of the happiness once experienced.</p><p>I did not hesitate with my reply, but always asked my parents to add a few words, which was meant to signify their approval. For in those times, it could be considered frivolous if I had corresponded with my fianc&#8217; alone.</p><p>A sad incident clouded my happiness. My youngest sister Helene suddenly fell ill with a dangerous nervous fever. She had already been given up by the doctors when improvement suddenly occurred, and our dearest little sister was given back to us by God. And it happened like this: As my little sister lay there corpse-pale and unconscious, the doctors tried one last remedy. The child was placed in a cold bath, where it remained for ten minutes. Then it was put back into the well pre-warmed bed. In the excitement of the moment, a hot water bottle had been forgotten. The child lay on the bottle. A deep burn wound formed. That was a stroke of luck for the child. The doctors believed that without this wound, it would have perished. I believe this was related to the medical views of the time. It was once customary to apply the &#8220;hair-rope&#8220; method for dangerous diseases. The festering wound
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[51]" id="pgepubid00056"><a id="Seite_51" title="[51]"/></span>&#8212; so it was believed &#8212; would draw the illness out of the body. Slowly but steadily, recovery progressed. But the child remained confined to bed for months. I had to perform the duties of a nurse alongside my younger sister, because it was more pleasant for the suffering child to have relatives nearby instead of a strange nurse. Day and night I was with her. I had a bed next to hers and, since she could not reach herself, I fed her. It was a difficult time for me. Only the letters from my fianc&#8217; strengthened my courage and gave me new strength.</p><p>But a time of trial was also to come for me. I heard it &#8220;through the grapevine&#8220; that my parents no longer approved of the frequent correspondence with my fianc&#8217;, because in their opinion &#8220;the matter, i.e., my entire engagement, was not entirely secure at all.&#8220; My pain was boundless. I spent days and nights in tears. I searched for the cause of the displeasure, but could not find out anything for a long time. Finally, my younger brother-in-law took pity on me and told me that my fianc&#8217; had been slandered to our parents and described as the epitome of all evil qualities. I suffered unspeakably. Father grieved. The mood in the house was very somber. Finally, Father wrote to Homel, a small town near Konotop, where a relative of ours, Reb Eisek Epstein, lived, and asked him to inquire precisely about the state of affairs. Soon an answer arrived, which proved the groundlessness of all the slanders. The Wengeroff family, our
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[52]" id="pgepubid00057"><a id="Seite_52" title="[52]"/></span>
relative wrote, was a distinguished one, and the young man was an upright person and a good Talmudist. These tidings quelled the storm in our house. The dark clouds dispersed. Above my life, the bright, clear sky shone once more.</p><p>I rejoiced. My longing for love grew even stronger. Our correspondence became more frequent. My siblings teased me and laughed, when a letter arrived. But they rejoiced with me.</p><p>Life in my parents&#8217; house followed its usual course. Winter was nearing its end, and spring announced itself very early this year. My sister recovered well and was already able to leave her bed. Our mother made extensive preparations for the creation of my trousseau. Linen, silk, and woolen fabrics. Laces were acquired. They advised, chose, purchased. It was a hurried bustle.</p><p>I was often consulted as well. But I always expressed my opinion only shyly and blushingly.</p><p>The laundry was made outside the house, but the clothes were sewn at home. Not seamstresses, but journeyman tailors worked on them. They were all young lads who, by chance, also belonged to the synagogue choir. While working, they often and gladly sang songs, mostly of a religious character, such as Purim plays, Ahasuerus play, Joseph play. The latter was their favorite play, which they repeated very often. They distributed the roles among themselves and sang as follows:</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[53]" id="pgepubid00058"><a id="Seite_53" title="[53]"/></span></p><div class="center">1.</div><div class="center"><em class="gesperrt">Jacob:</em></div><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

departing for Konotop, I was still to go to Warsaw to bid farewell to relatives, but above all to my grandfather, and to receive his blessing for my marriage.</p><p>It was the beginning of August 1849. At that time, the Polish-Russian border still existed near the small town of Terespol, which was four Russian versts away from Brest. I undertook this journey with my father. But before the border, he was forced to leave me; and I had to handle all border formalities myself. It was my first independent step. I must confess, my courage was not great. When I arrived at the office where I had to present my passport, I felt very anxious. Tears came to my eyes. I would have loved to sob like a small child. I was ashamed of this weakness and tried to control myself. In the office, I was asked to sign a document: another independent act! Finally, I found myself on the other side of the border. Here I was awaited by our friend Reb Jossele, who took me to his family in the small town of Terespol. The next day, my eagerly awaited father arrived, and we traveled together to Warsaw.</p><p>Our stay in Warsaw lasted eight days. The grandfather greeted me with special attention. The aunts and uncles treated me the whole time with great tenderness. I received from everyone pretty wedding gifts and from the grandfather a silver coin and &#8212; the blessing.</p><p>It was a moment I cannot forget: <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[59]" id="pgepubid00063"><a id="Seite_59" title="[59]"/></span> Grandfather stood in the middle of the salon. With a beating heart I approached him and bowed my head in humble submission. He laid his hands on my head and spoke aloud the blessing with a moving, trembling voice. A solemn stillness filled the room. Only the aunts sobbed softly. &#8212; I felt so serious, so sad. It was only then that I truly felt what serious turn my life should take. With anxious hearts I bade farewell to my dear, venerable grandfather; for the thought would not leave me that I would see him for the last time in my life.</p><p>Thoughtful and more serious than I had come, I returned home. The trousseau was ready. My mother packed all the beautiful new things with love and care into a massive, large trunk covered with iron sheeting. Besides the laundry I received the following items:</p><blockquote><div>
<p>1. The wedding dress: of heavy gray silk — a strip of &#171;moire antique&#187; and a strip Atlas, garnished with broad gray blonde lace (lace made of flock silk);</p>
<p>2. a dress made of Mousseline de laine — dark blue and white checked; ankle-length, very casual, simple cut; top with a saddle, in the middle belt, long Greek sleeves;</p>
<p>3. a dress in dark blue Atlas, with dark blue velvet garnishing the front; narrow, long sleeves with velvet cuffs;</p>
<p>4. a black taffeta dress — &#171;Mantine&#187; — without any trimming;</p>
</div></blockquote><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[60]" id="pgepubid00064"><a id="Seite_60" title="[60]"/></span></p><blockquote><div>
<p>5. a dress made of green wool fabric garnished with black lace in beautiful patterns;</p></div></blockquote><p>ferner: 2 Schlafröcke:</p><blockquote><div>
<p>one made of light blue muslin with simple white lace,</p>
<p>the other made of &#8220;Teefteek&#8221; (Turkish fabric); very loosely made — &#8216;Rubaschka&#8217; (shirt) named.</p>
</div></blockquote><p>Ferner: 3 Mäntel:</p><blockquote><div>
<p>one &#8220;Mandaronka&#8221; — so was the then-common form of raincoat called — made of dark blue cloth;</p>
<p>one &#8220;Ziganka&#8221; — gray silk fabric; a square piece simply gathered at the neck and at the sleeves; garnished with red, silk ribbon and gray tassels;</p>
<p>one &#8220;Algierka&#8221; — a long coat with Grecian sleeves, empire, of black silk. In front at the chest were two silk cords attached, which over the shoulders to the back hung loosely with two large tassels.</p>
</div></blockquote><p>Ferner 2 Tageshauben:</p><blockquote><div>
<p>one made of blonde lace with blue ribbon — for holidays, the other simpler for everyday</p>
<p>and six morning caps in coquettish shapes.</p>
<p>Ferner a pair of pink gloves adorned with white tulle lace — for the wedding! —</p>
</div></blockquote><p>Everything was thus prepared, and preparations were made for the great journey. I was left to my own devices and had time to bid farewell to all that was dear to me. <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[61]" id="pgepubid00065"><a id="Seite_61" title="[61]"/></span> It were heavy days for me — a jumble of feelings and sensations raged within me. Soon the thought of reunion with my dearly beloved filled me with such radiant joy that everyone who stood in my way had to smile. I looked so happy. Soon tears came to my eyes, and I sobbed softly in some corner, overwhelmed by the pain of separation. Yet soon I laughed again and laughed with bliss and happiness.</p><p>Den letzten Sonntag vor der Abreise hatte ich noch Abschiedsbesuche bei Verwandten, Freunden und Bekannten zu machen — ich erfüllte diese Pflicht in Begleitung einer älteren Frau, Reisele genannt, die in der ganzen Stadt als Sarwerke<a id="FNanchor_3_3"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="6598946804666338120_46307-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_3_3">[3]</a> bekannt war und allen jüdischen Bräuten in Brest als Ehrenbegleiterin diente.</p><p>Es kam der vorletzte Tag. Wir saßen alle beisammen am Mittagstisch, als meine ältere Schwester auf mein ungewöhnlich blasses Aussehen aufmerksam wurde. Auch die anderen bemerkten es, und der Vater forderte mich zärtlich besorgt auf, ihm die Ursache meiner Sorgen zu sagen. Es war ein Traum, der mich quälte: Mir träumte, ich wäre ganz allein in der kleinen, engen Gasse, durch die ich einst als kleines Mädchen täglich mit dem »Behelfer« zum Cheder gegangen war. Plötzlich raste ein großer, schwarzer Ochse in wilden Sprüngen auf mich zu. Ich bebte vor Schrecken, denn der Ochse mit seinen Riesenhörnern kam immer näher. Ich suchte mich zu verbergen, konnte aber keinen Winkel finden, lief nach rechts und links. Doch das schwarze Ungeheuer folgte mir überall. Ich war endlich ganz erschöpft vor Angst und Müdigkeit und ergab mich meinem Schicksal. Da tauchte plötzlich im Halbdunkel des engen Gäßchens ein kleines Männchen auf. Es trug einen seidenen schwarzen Kaftan mit Gürtel und hoher Zobelmütze. Sein Gesicht war ganz runzlig. Es hatte die Züge meines Großvaters. Sein Gesicht umrahmte ein ungewöhnlich langer grauer Bart, der bis zu den Knien reichte. Das Männchen näherte sich mir, nahm mich an der Hand und sagte, indem es einen Seitenblick auf das Ungeheuer warf: »Komm mit mir, fürchte dich nicht!« Vertrauensvoll und dankbar ging ich mit ihm. Nach einer Weile aber blieb er stehen, ließ meine Hand los, wies mir den geraden Weg und verschwand ganz plötzlich meinen Blicken. Mit einem Male war auch das Ungeheuer nicht mehr da. Am ganzen Körper zitternd, erwachte ich und konnte den Eindruck dieses schweren Traumes gar nicht mehr loswerden. Alle hörten mir mit Spannung zu. Am meist bewegt aber war der Vater. Als ich mit dem Erzählen zu Ende war, erhob er sich rasch vom Tisch und begab sich in sein Arbeitszimmer, wo er in einem Buch nachblätterte. Freudestrahlend kam er zurück und rief mir zu: »Sei ruhig, meine Tochter, du wirst Kinder haben, die viel lachen werden.«</p><p>Ich wurde schamrot und wagte niemanden anzuschauen. Die Meinigen lachten und neckten mich und wollten mich zum Aufschauen zwingen. Ich aber verharrte bis zum Schluß des Mittagmahles in der gleichen Haltung.</p><p>Für den nächsten Tag war unsere Abreise bestimmt. <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[63]" id="pgepubid00067"><a id="Seite_63" title="[63]"/></span> Schon stand unser Reisewagen vor dem Hause. Es war ein langes, mit Leder überzogenes und mit kleinen Fenstern und Vorhängen versehenes Fuhrwerk, »Fürgon« genannt. Drei Postpferde waren davorgespannt. — Die Aufregung im Hause erreichte ihren Höhepunkt. Man lief hin und her. Man raffte noch mancherlei zusammen und packte es in den Wagen: es gab noch sehr viel zu tun in dieser letzten Stunde vor der Abreise. Der Wagen war also außen und innen stark beladen, sollten wir doch vierzehn Tage unterwegs bleiben. Deshalb nahmen wir großen Vorrat von Backwerk, geräuchertem Fleisch, gesalzenen Sachen mit, ferner eine ganze Kiste mit Cognak, Rum, Schnaps, Wein, Tee und Zucker. Das mußte ja reichen für uns alle. Diese Nahrungsmittel fanden Platz in einer großen, viereckigen, mit weißem Fell überzogenen und mit Blechstreifen beschlagenen Kiste, »Pogrebez« genannt. Fünf bequeme Sitze wurden für die Reisenden hergerichtet.</p><p>Ich konnte mich gar nicht vom Hause trennen. Da rief der Vater in befehlendem Tone: »Genug, genug!« und entschlossen half er mir zuerst in den Wagen. Es folgte meine Mutter, die jüngere von mir innig geliebte Schwester und der achtjährige Bruder. Ein kurzer, echt russischer Befehl »pascholl!« (los), und der Wagen setzte sich in Bewegung. Unter den Tränen, Wünschen und Segenssprüchen der Zurückgebliebenen fuhren wir ab. Ich schluchzte wie ein kleines Kind: der Wagen rollte immer schneller. Durch Tränen hindurch sah ich alte vertraute Straßen schwinden, Häuser, in denen ich jahrelang ein- und ausgegangen, um liebe Freunde zu besuchen, Menschen, denen ich solange jeden Tag begegnet. Meine Lieblingsplätzchen zogen an mir vorbei. Und hinter mir verschwand, um nie zurückzukehren, die schöne Zeit der sorglosen, glücklichen ersten Jugend. —</p><p class="pmb3">It was in the year 1850, the 5th of August.</p><p class="break"/><hr class="chap"/><p class="pmb3"/><h2 id="pgepubid00069"> <a id="Ankunft_in_Konotop_Hochzeit">Arrival in Konotop. Wedding.</a></h2><p>We traveled day and night, stopping the journey only for Sabbath rest from Friday noon to Saturday evening. After seven days, when we had covered half of our journey, the wagon failed. We were forced to pitch camp in an open field. A carpet was spread out and our provisions were taken out. Soon the samovar boiled and hummed. We gathered around it and, in its hum, in the familiar chatter, we forgot our uncomfortable position.</p><p>The wedding day drew ever nearer, and we were still so far from our destination. The father sent a courier to Konotop and asked for postponement of the wedding. In Konotop one was inconsolable about it and bore this eight-day delay long with my parents, for the large supplies of poultry and other foods would spoil in the hot season.</p><p>We traveled still six full days, experienced various adventures, and finally arrived at the penultimate station, <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[65]" id="pgepubid00070"><a id="Seite_65" title="[65]"/></span> Baturim.<a id="FNanchor_4_4"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="6598946804666338120_46307-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_4_4">[4]</a> Here a messenger brought us the news that the father-in-law, in the company of several gentlemen, awaited us at the next station.</p><p>My heart beat stormily. But I kept quiet steadfastly. For I felt that, like the first word, a stream of tears would follow. I was at the goal of my most beautiful dreams: in an hour my longing would become reality. — I hardly dared to think of such happiness, which perhaps is not vouchsafed to every girl by fate.</p><p>We girls made ourselves ready. I chose a dress that suited me very well, and I studied myself in the mirror, which told me of my own happiness. — Then we mounted and rode quickly on. En route a wagon came toward us. We already recognized from afar my father-in-law and Mr. Brim. We reached the last station before Konotop in half an hour, and from there we were very near our destination. We rode into Konotop. The suburb was not promising: only little huts with thatched roofs. My sister was almost horrified by the village character of the town. But to me everything was indifferent. What did the city matter to me then! Only the image of my fiancé hovered before me like the bright pillar of fire by night before the Israelites in the desert and banished all gloomy thoughts.</p><p>We rode through a long, unpaved street. Right and left the same thatched huts. Finally we came to a wide square, where the first large, distinguished stone house with a green metal roof stood. It was the goal of our journey; the house of the Wengeroff family. Accompanied by a curious crowd our wagon drove through the courtyard gate and halted before a large balcony, wholly filled with people.</p><p>My future mother-in-law came toward me, kissed me, and handed me a “sweet bread.” The impression this woman made on me was serious and respectful. By contrast, the aunt, the bridegroom’s stepmother, immediately won my trust and my affection. Her embrace also seemed warmer, more intimate and tender than the others. We were also introduced to the wife of my fiancé’s older brother and his younger sister. Of her I already knew so much good and love that I warmly embraced her as an old, trusted friend. But above all these people my eyes wandered farther, seeking the beloved, the nearest, whom I had longed for all year. But he was nowhere to be seen. Accompanied by everyone, I passed through the ante-room into the salon. Here my fiancé greeted me with a radiant smile. Our greeting was silent: there really was no need for words. The eyes said so much; they said more than any poet has yet found words for. —</p><p>Evening came. Countless lights burned, and the home and its people looked festive. Tea was served. The elder sister-in-law did not leave my mother's side, the younger did not leave mine. My fiancé, in order not to offend local custom, had to be with my father in the company of the gentlemen. However, he dared from time to time to sit by my side for a moment to whisper a few dear words to me.</p><p>Soon we were asked to dance. We two, my sister and I, had to join in as well, though our desire was not very strong. We danced the polka-mazurka with figures, which won great applause. In general: on this evening we were the center of the merry wedding party.</p><p>After the dance we were invited to table. My fiancé sat again with the older men on the other side of the table, and only by glances could we communicate.</p><p>The dinner was finished. Half-asleep from fatigue, I separated from my fiancé and all present. — When I remained alone with my sister in our lodging, we exchanged various remarks and observations about the company we had just left. Suddenly the door opened, and a very odd being appeared in the room. It was a small, stout person with a very blunt, truly Russian nose, small lively eyes, a broad sunburnt face in a most peculiar Little Russian costume. On his head he wore a turban of woolen, colorful cloth, to which bright red, artificial roses with even brighter green leaves were attached, hanging far into her face. At the front and back the whole body was covered with two colorful aprons — beneath it a much longer white shirt with puffed, colorfully embroidered sleeves. About the neck a mass of coral, colorful beads, brass coins and large rings in the ears. Shoes and stockings were missing, and the bare feet left much to be desired in cleanliness. It was the maid who brought us fresh water and asked about our wishes. We saw this strange attire for the first time, were for a moment speechless with surprise, and suddenly burst into loud, mischievous laughter. We laughed long after the girl had gone and chatted merrily. Before sleeping my sister Cäcilie hugged me passionately and cried out: “You are happy and will be very happy, sister!” I too believed in my happiness. The heart was full, beating so stormily. I could have embraced all of humanity in that moment. Overcome by happiness, lulled to sweet dreams, I fell asleep.</p><p>When I woke the next morning, the father was with the Mechutonim<span id="FNanchor_5_5"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="6598946804666338120_46307-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_5_5">[5]</a>. Mother and sister were ready to go out. From the other side people had already asked for me several times. I quickly dressed, and when I had finished my toilette, the mother herself brought me the Ziganka, and we left our quarters. At Wengeroffs we were expected for breakfast.</p><p>In the casual, intimate and cordial mood, my shyness also faded; we young people were allowed to retreat to another room. Twice we refused to be told this and were merry and carefree.</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[69]" id="pgepubid00074"><a id="Seite_69" title="[69]"/></span></p><p>The mother-in-law and the future sister-in-law expressed the wish to see my trousseau. They examined everything piece by piece with expertise and earnest interest, and my mother received great praise for this inspection. About one object in the laundry they were especially astonished, namely the underskirts, for when I came to Konotop, not a single woman wore such. Even in my sister Eva’s trousseau this item of clothing was missing. In the short time since my sister’s marriage, many new customs had been introduced into our house. The women in Konotop also did not yet wear underskirts, but wore the dress directly over the shirt. Wearing underskirts was already regarded as “Christian.” Only in winter did the women wear thick flannel underskirts and very thick, high gentleman’s boots. — Naturally, after a short time in Konotop everyone knew about this part of my trousseau; and it did not take long for other women in Konotop to follow my example. In any case, the Jewish women in Konotop found it easy to adopt a new, modern garment into their toilette.</p><p>Culturally, primarily socially, Konotop still lagged far behind Brest. Not much was known here about fashion. My things were admired; I, as I walked through the streets, was ogled; and after a short time I was considered to be the trendsetter in fashion in all of Konotop.</p><p>On the day before the wedding, guests from Petersburg were expected, a brother and brother-in-law of my future mother-in-law. They arrived during lunch. <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[70]" id="pgepubid00075"><a id="Seite_70" title="[70]"/></span> They were two pretty, dignified gentlemen. They wore short light silk summer suits, a kind of travel outfit, and broad-brimmed white straw hats, which they removed upon entering the dining room, so that they sat with bare heads, while the other men constantly kept a small, black velvet cap. My father-in-law was even somewhat affected. The free, easy behavior of his guests disturbed him all the more, as the presence of my dear father spread a deeply religious mood. Yet the young people quickly realized their mistake and soon began to conform to the others. So they put on their hats for the dessert prayer and murmured, forcedly, what seemed to us very amusing.</p><p>After lunch I left the company, for according to ancient custom I had to undergo ritual purification before my wedding. In this ceremony I endured the most unbearable torments, and my sensibility was put to a hard test. The religious formalities in the “Mikve” (the ritual bath) seemed to have no end. I was washed. My nails were carefully cleaned and, at the end, according to the regulation, I had to immerse myself three times in the basin. In silent obedience I fulfilled the commands of the old women who treated me like a sacrificial lamb. How glad I was when I was finally allowed to leave them!</p><p>In the evening, dancing resumed. And now not only girls participated, but some young men as well. It was indeed against custom; the elders, however, were gathered in another room, and the youth made use of the opportunity. On this evening, the eve of my wedding, we parted from each other early, yet I could not fall asleep for a long time and bidded farewell to my girlhood dreams with sadness.</p><p>The next day I woke with the thought that it was the most important day of my life. Today we all made a grand toilette. I put on the heavy gray-blue dress, placed the myrtle wreath with the long white veil on. White gloves, fans, and a delicate lace handkerchief completed my outfit. They threw the Ziganka mantle over me, and we boarded the wagon, which, accompanied by a gawking, curious crowd, brought us to the Wengeroff house. The two sisters-in-law welcomed us. In the salon we were greeted by the parents-in-law and many strangers, both ladies and gentlemen. Only after some time did my fiancé appear, surrounded by numerous men. He dared hardly look at me, for according to the local custom, the bride and groom should remain most apart from each other in the last hour before the wedding.</p><p>Without any ceremony, I was led into the wedding hall. Not even the armchair customary in our home was offered to me. I had to think back to my sister&#8217;s wedding&#8212;: how ceremonious everything had been there, how moved we siblings were when Father and Mother, to the sounds of touching music, led the bride into the hall and then seated her on an armchair that was in the middle of the parlor on a rug&#8212;. I felt sad at this memory,
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[72]" id="pgepubid00077"><a id="Seite_72" title="[72]"/></span>
and I felt a slight disappointment. My sensitivity increased to annoyance when I learned that the entire wedding ceremony, according to the local custom, was to take place in a large wooden barn in the courtyard. Mother, sister, and I could hardly believe it. However, refusing was out of the question, and we had to comply. To reassure us, we were told that a wedding in Konotop would never be celebrated differently, even if the most splendid rooms were available.</p><p>In the barn, we took seats on chairs, while the crowd settled on benches. The music struck up in loud, shrill tones, and an old woman danced into the barn with wild leaps, spinning in circles. High above her head, she held a round cake, and, singing cheerfully, she uttered the following words:</p><p>&#8220;Ziwie Kumanow, Ziwie Kumanow, Ziwie Kumanow!&#8221; With that, she encouraged the music to continue playing.</p><p>My sister and I had never experienced anything similar. Our astonishment was boundless. Soon, however, we were seized by a fit of laughter that we could not resist. My sister-in-law noticed it and hastened to explain the scene to us: According to local custom, every friend of the house sent the hostess a cake, which was presented in this strange manner. This explanation did not make the matter any less comical, nor did it lessen our laughter. The same ceremony was repeated several more times, only with the difference that each time the name of a different friend was called out.</p><p>At three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, the festivities in
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[73]" id="pgepubid00078"><a id="Seite_73" title="[73]"/></span>
the barn ended, and I withdrew to perform the evening prayer and change my dress. My mother accompanied me. With a moved voice, she spoke to me about the seriousness of the wedding day, which for the bride signifies a second Day of Atonement, on which she must implore God for forgiveness of all her past sins. Tears flowed incessantly from my eyes. I clutched the prayer book convulsively and prayed&#8230; My pious and solemn conversation with God lasted a good hour, and with tear-stained eyes, I reappeared in the barn. The girls present approached me, took off my bridal wreath, loosened my hair, which had been braided into small pigtails, so that the entire company of women could participate in the loosening of the hair, and spread it over my shoulders and neck. I sobbed with emotion. Then the groom appeared among the gentlemen, took the white silk cloth that lay spread over a plate filled with hop blossoms, and, at the rabbi&#8217;s instruction, covered my head with it, while all those standing around sprinkled me with hops, in exactly the same way as I had described in detail at my sister Eva&#8217;s wedding.&#8212;Then my groom was brought to the synagogue, and I was led there by my father and mother, where the act of marriage took place. Thereupon, I began the return journey on the arm of my newlywed husband, to cheerful music. I could not see the way, as my thick silk cloth over my eyes made me as if blind.</p><p>Upon arriving home, we retired to the guest room, where I was finally allowed to lift the silk cloth for a moment
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[74]" id="pgepubid00079"><a id="Seite_74" title="[74]"/></span>
to see my husband for the first time after the wedding. We were served tea, which we drank with true delight. For, according to Jewish custom, we had fasted until this hour.</p><p>During dinner, which was set in the barn and attended by the entire town, I sat at the ladies&#8217; table and my husband at the gentlemen&#8217;s table. The &#8220;Sheva Broches,&#8221; the seven blessings that the rabbi had recited during the consecration of the couple, were repeated here, a ceremony that must be observed for an entire week, and on special occasions even during the entire honeymoon. This wedding feast (Chuppewetschere) extended until midnight, for cheering up the Chosson and Kalle (m&#8217;ssameach chosson w&#8217;kaloh) was among the greatest Mizwaus, i.e., acts pleasing to God.</p><p>The next morning, the woman armed with scissors appeared, and at my mother&#8217;s command, she cut off my hair. A little of my forehead hair was left for me as a keepsake. But even this was covered by the wig.</p><p>The wig was already an improvement; my last married sister had only received a tight-fitting head covering made of fabric and a hair-colored band.</p><p>The operation was over. I looked in the mirror and was horrified at my transformed appearance. But my husband lovingly comforted me and assured me that I looked just as nice as before. So I gradually calmed down. In the artfully crafted wig with a coquettish cap, in a pretty silk dress, I appeared in the hall, led by my mother and mother-in-law. I was generally liked in my new attire, and many a remark was made that made me blush. My husband did not leave my side.</p><p>The last four weeks before the wedding, I was so protected that I was literally not allowed to take a single step alone. A superstition prevailed both among the common people and among the Jewish intelligentsia of the time, that evil spirits in the last four weeks, which are called: copper, brass, silver, and gold, but especially in the last one, could take possession of the bride and have easy access to her if she were alone. For this reason, a bride, both by day and by night, was not left alone for a moment until after the Chuppah. After the Chuppah, the evil spirits lost their power. Now my fear of the spirits, which I saw lurking everywhere, also ceased, and I rejoiced in my freedom.</p><p>A few days passed in joy and delight. I felt at home in the new living conditions and no longer thought with such fear of the separation from my parents.</p><p>Rosh Hashanah was at the door, and my parents wanted to leave. But the Wengeroffs would not let them go. They accepted the cordial invitation, and we spent the holidays together. But after the holidays, they began their return journey to Brest, and we said goodbye to each other for a few years.</p><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[76]" id="pgepubid00081"><a id="Seite_76" title="[76]"/></span></p><p class="pmb3">And so I came as the wife of a dearly beloved, but still unknown, man to a foreign country, among foreign people, foreign customs, and had to find my way in all that was new at eighteen years old. Thus, in those times, parents married off their unprepared, almost unsuspecting children, and although they loved them tenderly, they harbored no doubt or misgivings. With confidence in God&#8217;s help, they entrusted their children to their fate. Thus began my regulated Jewish married life&#8230;</p><p class="break"/><hr class="chap"/><p><span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[77]" id="pgepubid00082"><a id="Seite_77" title="[77]"/></span></p><div class="pmb3"/><h2 id="pgepubid00083"> <a id="Vier_Jahre">Four Years
in the House of My In-Laws.</a></h2><p>Konotop, which was now to become my second home, was a small town of ten thousand inhabitants. In appearance, Konotop gave entirely the impression of a village.</p><p>The main population in Konotop consisted of Christians&#8212;merchants, officials, and farmers. The Jews, who lived here in a very small number, were mainly grain merchants and innkeepers. My father-in-law, the richest man in the place, was the &#8220;Otkupshchik&#8221; of Konotop. At that time, the government contractually granted a rich merchant&#8212;Russian, Jew, or Greek&#8212;the monopoly on brandy and alcoholic beverages. According to this contract, the concessionaire &#8220;Otkupshchik&#8221; was obliged, in addition to the security deposit, which consisted of real estate and government bonds, to pay a certain sum into the state treasury every month; if payment was delayed for one, or at most two months, the security deposit was forfeited, and the concession reverted to the government. Every city had such a concessionaire. This lease was very profitable for the state&#8212;the profit was estimated at one hundred million rubles annually, a sum
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[78]" id="pgepubid00084"><a id="Seite_78" title="[78]"/></span>
which, as was generally said, was used exclusively for the army. But the concessionaires also had good earnings if business was normal. They enjoyed all freedoms and protection from the authorities, led a distinguished, rich life, often gave large parties where lavish feasting and drinking took place. The most beautiful horses, the most elegant carriages in the city belonged to them. Like petty autocrats, they lived in their surroundings.</p><p>My father-in-law, as I said, owned such a brandy concession. The enjoyment of wine and beer was known only to the upper strata of society at that time. The common people drank schnapps. Of course, even the upper ten thousand did not despise schnapps and gladly drank a small glass to stimulate their appetite. The worker already used larger doses to &#8220;strengthen his forces&#8221; during breaks. But the greatest sales of schnapps were in the countryside among the peasants, who drank it to stupefy themselves. The tavern was their club, where they always directed their steps after work, where they drank their &#8220;vodka,&#8221; sometimes singing sad, sometimes cheerful songs, and often dancing in a stupor.</p><p>The tempting schnapps was much more expensive in the cities than in the countryside. Therefore, it was smuggled. At that time, there was a &#8220;Rogatka&#8221; (barrier) in front of every city. A &#8220;Strazhnik&#8221; (guard with a large brass badge, the emblem of the concession, on his chest and a thin iron stick in his hand) was the guardian of the border. With this stick, he searched every wagon that passed him, and woe to the peasant or the merchant in whom something was found. The unfortunate person was dragged to the administrative office, and the facts were recorded. The apprehended person was treated like a criminal; and he never escaped a large fine.</p><p>The concessionaires counted on such fortunate coincidences from the outset. They partially covered the large expenses for personnel, for the numerous supervisors on foot and on horseback. But despite the numerous border guards, a great deal was smuggled, and entire shipments of 20 to 30 barrels were transported to the cities by circuitous routes through ravines, through forests on dark, stormy winter nights. It was not uncommon for bitter fights to break out between the armed border guards and the equally armed smugglers. How often were there dead and wounded in these clashes! The captured wagons were brought triumphantly to the administrative building; and now the trial began.&#8212;The employees knew no exceptions&#8212;everyone who crossed the border had to undergo a revision. And so they also bothered the pilgrims who, barefoot, journeyed from all ends of Russia to the holy city of Kyiv, where the catacombs of the immensely rich church &#8220;Pecherska Lavra&#8221; preserve the remains of many saints and where the tomb of the first Russian ruler, Vladimir the Saint, is located. The small bottle of brandy that the pilgrims, among whom were often the most distinguished women and men of the country, carried with them for their strengthening and for rubbing their sore feet, was mostly taken from them with insults and threats.
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[80]" id="pgepubid00086"><a id="Seite_80" title="[80]"/></span>
Only rarely were the pilgrims allowed to go their holy way unpunished.</p><p>Most of the Jews in Konotop were Hasidim, a sect so often misunderstood in its essence, so often slandered in its teachings. About one hundred and fifty years ago, Hasidism originated in Volhynia as a reaction against the dry Talmudic scholarship predominantly prevalent in Lithuania. It was, as it were, the struggle of emerging mysticism and romanticism against cool rationalism. True, genuine piety does not consist in sophistry and complicated, subtle interpretations of a biblical word, not in incessant brooding over the Talmud, not in lifeless verbal skirmishes. God should be served with heart and feeling. Enthusiasm, fervor, ecstasy must remove man from all material things and elevate him to spiritual heights, to the harmony of the spheres. Thus teach the Hasidim. According to their later teachings, only a few can ever attain higher enlightenment, divine inspiration, through absolute spiritualization. This is the Zaddik, the Rebbe, to whom unconditional faith and trust must be given. Life should not be killed, but elevated and intensified. Divine service must be performed joyfully and exultantly, and there must be beauty everywhere. The beauty of the Rebbe reveals itself in all his movements and sweeps his followers into rapture. And so the Hasidim pilgrimage to the Rebbe on every occasion, not only to learn Torah and say prayers, but to live in piety and enjoy his beauty. The Rebbe partakes in God. His followers want to partake in him. Thus, they passionately grasp for the remnants of his food. Thus, in ecstasy, they follow his smallest movements, seek to observe him in his dance and dance with him. Prayers are performed dancing, communal meals are joyfully taken, and between individual meals, songs are sung in chorus, which the Rebbe initiates. Thus, a Hasidic sage, Rabbi Leib, recounts: &#8220;I often traveled to the Maggid (preacher) of Mezritch (a small place in Poland), not to hear new Torah insights, but to see how he took off and put on his socks.&#8221;</p><p>In another Hasidic book it is told: &#8220;Never did the grandfather from Spale<a id="FNanchor_6_6"/><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="6598946804666338120_46307-h-2.htm.xhtml#Footnote_6_6">[6]</a> come so close to God, never did he unite so intimately with Him, as during his dance on Sabbath and Yom Tov.&#8221; He then possessed the natural lightness and cheerfulness of a four-year-old child. Whoever watched his dance would immediately awaken feelings of repentance and remorse. The heart filled with joy, and the eyes became tearful. Rabbi Scholem was once with the &#8220;grandfather from Spale.&#8221; Full of ecstasy, he sat in a corner of the room, while in another, the &#8220;grandfather&#8221; sat. After the meal, the grandfather suddenly asked Rabbi Scholem if he could dance. &#8220;No,&#8221; answered Rabbi Scholem. &#8220;Then see how the grandfather dances.&#8221; The grandfather quickly rose from his seat and began a magnificent dance. Full of enthusiasm, Rabbi Scholem stood there: &#8220;Look, look how the grandfather dances!&#8221; This scene repeated itself several times, and Rabbi
    <span class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[82]" id="pgepubid00088"><a id="Seite_82" title="[82]"/></span>
Scholem spoke to those present: &#8220;Believe me, his limbs are infinitely sacred, with every step he elevates himself to the Godhead, unites with the Godhead.&#8221; The next day, Rabbi Scholem sat motionless, admiring the old grandfather.</p><p>The Hasidim also have a great understanding of natural beauty; and it seems almost pantheistic to us when it is told of Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav that he climbed the highest levels of divinity because he wandered through fields and forests, together with nature directed hymns of praise to God, recited psalms in deep caves, and drove all alone in a small boat on the large, wide lake.</p><p>The Rebbe is the embodiment of all spiritual nobility. In him, God is most purely revealed. Must it not then be self-evident that the Rebbe&#8217;s life is detached from all material worries? Everyone, even the poorest Hasid, considers it his foremost duty to donate the so-called Pidyonim for the Rebbe&#8217;s sustenance. In this zeal, the most diverse subgroups of Hasidim are united.</p><p>It is a strange life that the Hasidim lead. They consecrate their bodies, for it too is a gift from the Lord. Only in the highest purity do they wish to appear before their God. Frequent washings, multiple baths during the day, especially in flowing waters, regardless of whether it is winter or summer, are acts of worship.</p><p>Despite all these pious exercises, it must be noted that the Lithuanian Hasidim are much more sober and show more understanding for practical life than the Polish ones. They are thoughtful merchants, good family fathers, and faithful husbands. Their entire otherworldly ecstasy finds its expression in prayer. Especially in those holy hours when they travel once a year to their Rebbe for the Rosh Hashanah festival. In their Rebbe is bliss and the certainty of the future. One only needs to place a piece of paper containing all wishes for the coming year on the Zaddik&#8217;s grave, and one can go home reassured. The Rabbi will bend fate. Deep, mystical ideas dominate the thoughts and actions of the Hasidim. And it would mean treading the intricate paths of the Kabbalah if one were to seek to recognize the deeper connections of their often strange customs. Thus, I recall that before the terrible Day of Atonement, on which the Almighty decides over life and death, large wax candles are made in Hasidic as well as in Misnagdic homes. But the seven-times folded wick is not placed in the wax until the names of every living family member, as well as every deceased one, have been assembled from the threads. Between the living and the dead, there is, after all, only an external difference.</p><p>Richer in customs, and incomparably more internalized, is the life of the Polish Hasidim. Even today&#8212;in these agitated times&#8212;Hasidism still has the largest number of its followers precisely in Poland. There, it has lost little of its old strength and its old forms. In those times of which I report here, the Polish Hasid was a being whose life floated between heaven and earth and, in its transfiguration, seemed removed from practical everyday life. Only in prayer did his humanity mature into wholeness and beauty. So holy was prayer that it could only ascend from the soul when all earthly thoughts were banished. Rather not pray at all than pray without fervor, was their principle. Therefore, they disdained the temporal limits prescribed for prayer; they awaited the solemn hours. And if the soul did not want to soar into oblivion of the world, then a small glass of wine&#8212;the breaker of worries, the bringer of heavenly joys&#8212;had to help. Their eyes, from which the flames of inner fire struck, saw the world filled with good and evil spirits. They took on manifold forms. Thus, the woman appeared to them as a demon who seduces people and drags them down into baseness. Better to take a long detour than to walk between two women.</p><p>The relationship of the rest of Jewry&#8212;the Misnagdim&#8212;to the Hasidim is very hostile. Between the Lithuanian Hasidim and Misnagdim, there are fewer differences. And conflicts are rare because they also have much in common, mainly the veneration of the Talmud. The Polish Hasidim, on the other hand, more or less ignore the Talmud and draw their wisdom and enthusiasm from <em class="gesperrt">their</em> holy books. An interesting and characteristic proof of this hostile relationship between the two directions is the little song of the Misnagdim about the Hasidim:</p>
